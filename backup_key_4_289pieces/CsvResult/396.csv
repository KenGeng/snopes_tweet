Becomes very evident when potholes go unpatched, or when new construction tears up the road.				973434498904805376	973416975559925760	mrandystevens	https://twitter.com/SounderBruce/status/973434498904805376

It’s a road paving material made by blending ground-up recycled tires with asphalt. Let’s try something different. http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/tires/rac/		@ MayorMemphis @ CVentura_WREG3		968704399936753664			https://twitter.com/kelvingates/status/968704399936753664
