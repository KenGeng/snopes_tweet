SeibaaHomu	2018-02-22 00:06	0	1	Haha good, because Ted Cruz once made a competition where you could ‘Netflix and chill’ with him but... well I don’t think he knew what it meant. It’s not REALLY romance but one movie I really like is Baby Driver. I think it has the same lead actor as The Fault in Our Stars				966539633541578753	966310144060502017	GuiltyNightEmi	https://twitter.com/SeibaaHomu/status/966539633541578753	
JaimeRRocketSci	2017-12-20 00:24	0	0	Remember when Ted Cruz AKA The Zodiac Killer was asking people to "Netflix and chill" with him? Well the former first lady of Mexico @ Mzavalagc trying to sell her own book it's almost as cringy. # WHY? # PolitiFail		@ Mzavalagc	# WHY # PolitiFail	943351315891150848			https://twitter.com/JaimeRRocketSci/status/943351315891150848

And how are ISPs gonna pay for that and still remain profitable enough to stay open (so you can have your Netflix & chill)? You didn't think about that.				943074810174812160	941489723901665280	edcarmonajr tedcruz	https://twitter.com/SleeveMeAlone/status/943074810174812160	
PolitiHate	2017-12-18 18:29	0	0	With net neutrality, Mega content oligopolies and excessive consumers of it are subsidized for the massive amount of bandwidth they take up and average consumers are forced to pay for them. Pay the real cost for Netflix and chill. Let me peruse twitter at a lower cost.				942899705247387648	941489723901665280	Wilcox_Music tedcruz	https://twitter.com/PolitiHate/status/942899705247387648
