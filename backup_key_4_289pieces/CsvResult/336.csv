Hjdshopgirl	2018-07-21 17:50	0	0	As a person that had to hire people... We couldn't find enough help.& businesses that needed seasonal help couldn't get help. Some businesses went under or lost money. Low unemployment is good, but the people complaining they we're losing jobs weren't taking the jobs available				1020788206592319488	1020329851759284224	mojavethorn cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/Hjdshopgirl/status/1020788206592319488

GNP is nearly 4%. Why not give credit?				1020783955488862209	1020329851759284224	Hjdshopgirl cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/mojavethorn/status/1020783955488862209

Like his tax cuts really only helped rich people and companies. They didn't raise pay, but spent the money on stock buy backs. Also it raised our deficit to a crazy level.				1020751578813337601	1020329851759284224	mojavethorn cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/Hjdshopgirl/status/1020751578813337601

mojavethorn	2018-07-21 13:12	0	0	Rolling back regs because many were more harmful than helpful. Tax cuts because economy has been flat too long. Getting hostages out of NK and maybe some gain on nukes. Pushing for wall and stoping illegal immigration as much as possible. Going after MS13.

Trump is universal hated because he has proudly displayed his behaviour to the world for four decades.				1020715475788095488	1020329851759284224	godkill34583771 cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/SNovuka/status/1020715475788095488
