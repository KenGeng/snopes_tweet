hitthespot10	2018-07-19 13:03	1	1	Papa john’s founder John Schnatter is a human scumbag. He’s the guy who cut the hours of his workers so he didn’t have to give them health insurance, most of them had to be subsidized by our taxes. And he got big taxes breaks too. Talk about unpatriotic. His pizza sucks too.				1019991113309081604	1019970966238187525	shomaristone	https://twitter.com/hitthespot10/status/1019991113309081604
