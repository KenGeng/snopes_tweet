decisiveart1	2018-07-17 01:33	0	1	Oh, honey, do you not know what a meme is? Any kid with a tablet can put together a meme. Look it up in the dictionary, "its a basic search". A humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users.				1019092786514186240	1018727890345693184	LakerSteve GrammyPammyRose realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/decisiveart1/status/1019092786514186240
