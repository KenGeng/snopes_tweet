SkylifeMagazine	2018-07-21 03:00	0	2	Sometimes things don’t go as planned. Sometimes the road leads to a cliff. But even then you need to look up, not down. It’s time to delve into deep thoughts with an unusual photograph from the magnificent Indonesian island of Bali.

All the evidence points to continued exploitation of all our natural resources for profit. They could start with something simple: stopping the shooting of birds... https://twitter.com/mstantonuk/status/1019622821557874688 …				1020239476776464384			https://twitter.com/PaulCliffcouk/status/1020239476776464384

karahazel	2018-07-18 13:26	0	1	My grandmother was an enormous Cliff Richard fan. When she fell into a coma after a brain haemorrhage, the family (desperate to help her wake up, having heard he’d sent tapes to other fans) wrote and asked if he would record a short message for her. He sent a signed photograph.				1019634632604733442	1019616400124637185	PaulbernalUK	https://twitter.com/karahazel/status/1019634632604733442	
MundayHugh	2018-07-18 09:28	0	5	Can we have an investigation on the @ CountDankulaTV case where the press in Scotland turned up to photograph him being arrested, is this normal ? Strange that the press knew he was being arrested before him don’t you think ? Hooray for Sir Cliff though eh		@ CountDankulaTV		1019574568451756032	1019506771256401920	murdo_fraser 2351onthelist	https://twitter.com/MundayHugh/status/1019574568451756032	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f44d.png

robertdhughes63	2018-07-15 12:36	4	20	Swallows are starting to gather at Montrose Point in Chicago. This phenomenon has a narrow window - just a few weeks in July - and won't last much longer. This is a great way to study and photograph these birds. In the photo are Barn, Tree, and Cliff Swallows.
