DestinyTizzle	2018-07-18 11:32	1	6	1YES! White privilege is sadly real. It could be in terms of getting jobs, time in jail (sentencing) or even sitting in a Starbucks. Two white men don’t really worry about having the police called on them while sitting in a coffee shop.

ashonthetw1tter	2018-07-16 10:16	0	0	Why didn’t the Starbucks employee call the police on the white people who sat in the cafe and used the restroom without ordering anything? Sitting in an open coffee shop is not “trespassing”.				1018861923432050688	1018775496698392577	ashonthetw1tter 84_morpheus NPR	https://twitter.com/ashonthetw1tter/status/1018861923432050688

You're going to forget all your umbrage and disgust, take a sip of your Starbucks coffee and turn us in. See John, we minorities pay attention to history.

DutchGlobalResi	2018-07-07 07:36	0	1	As a white woman I would say to people of color: start reporting white people to the police (for barbecueing in the park, mowing the lawn, sitting in Starbucks without a coffee, for swimming in a pool, for making notes on a phone and so on) # resist # BlackLivesMatter # equality			# resist # BlackLivesMatter # equality	1015560076956979200	1014698286815567875	AuthenticAmUS	https://twitter.com/DutchGlobalResi/status/1015560076956979200	https://abs.twimg.com/hashflags/BlackHistoryMonth/BlackHistoryMonth.png
