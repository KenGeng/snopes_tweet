If you enter a tribal area and start clearing the forest, the tribals will attack you.				1020751187555991552	1020748041312227329	Javedakhtarjadu	https://twitter.com/hodlvolk/status/1020751187555991552

SixieGames	2018-07-19 23:20	0	1	Also, keep being racist. This is about them disrespecting black lives, not about their tax status. Point in fact, if you care so much about their tax status, go make your own twitter thread. Otherwise, leave. You're missing the forest for the trees because you have a low IQ.				1020146308139626496	1020078831737110528	TheRoach17 Endithinks	https://twitter.com/SixieGames/status/1020146308139626496
