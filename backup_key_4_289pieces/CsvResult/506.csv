trudyscousin	2018-07-17 07:08	0	0	I'm looking forward to the day there is no longer a Trump Tower; there is no longer any Trump International Hotel or golf course; Scotland's beach is restored, and @ realdonaldtrump is reduced to a number and an orange jumpsuit. Since yesterday, none of us will wait much longer.		@ realdonaldtrump		1019177103210606592			https://twitter.com/trudyscousin/status/1019177103210606592

izzy_the_bob	2018-06-28 08:41	2	0	Trump is appointing Chuck Rettig to head up the IRS. That's the same Chuck Rettig who owns properties at Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel Waikiki. The same Rettig who has, in the past, failed to report income to the IRS.
