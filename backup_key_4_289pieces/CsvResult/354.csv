Mysterious disaster has occurred in film & country becoming warzone yet cash still accepted for gas etc? Skeptical. Will see if it changes as scenario unfolds. In real crisis cash would be useless.				1019801963939020800			https://twitter.com/paulrbrian/status/1019801963939020800

arquestian1	2018-07-06 09:04	0	0	A crisis actor is someone hired during a crisis or disaster to portray a victim. Usually for things like drills or practices, but conspiracy theorists often accuse those who have truly been involved in things like school shootings of being such. You're welcome, kid.				1015220007385608192	1013893262044692481	1TommyGunn ShawnaLeneeShow	https://twitter.com/arquestian1/status/1015220007385608192

whisperindave	2018-07-03 01:56	0	0	No.1. There is no such thing as a "Crisis Actor." At no time has anyone pretended to be shot or be in a disaster just to make a disaster look real. That was a made up term straight from Alex Jones. No. 2.

To address the refugee crisis, we must also address its roots and the total lack of accountability of actors that midwifed and perpetuated Libya's state failure and this militia's paradise.				1013534925495197696	1013527156645879812	HamamAlfasi JFCrisp c_mcandrews	https://twitter.com/burweila/status/1013534925495197696
