Add in illegal electoral/electoralactivities. Russia’s involvement opens the door to one of the few instances of SCOTUS original jurisdiction				1000085616707686400	999289193326174213	Terp82CS Michael_Fisher_	https://twitter.com/M1Catalyst/status/1000085616707686400	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f4b0.png
DenbrotS	2018-05-24 10:05	159	251	Even w/o Michigan, it’s obvious The Election was rigged. Electoral Fraud includes gerrymandering, Purging Of Voter Rolls, Voter Suppression, as well as hacking. That’s millions of votes. Russia,Trump& RNC fixed the election. When everyone said Trump can never win we were right. pic.twitter.com/HsZvGoBr0G				999652508594327552	999395074025967616	mad1nola JudyWoodruff NewsHour	https://twitter.com/DenbrotS/status/999652508594327552	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dd96poZV4AAAgt3.jpg
PeterNimmo1	2018-04-24 14:12	0	0	Well, yes. Donald Trump is so exercised by the threat to democracy that he's set up a panel on electoral fraud (whilst doing little about the intelligence agencies' finding that Russia intervened in his election)				988843014243135489	988492289675878400	AlistairMay	https://twitter.com/PeterNimmo1/status/988843014243135489	
MrDash109	2018-04-12 12:24	0	0	Parallel between Harper & acolyte Andrew Scheer's Reform Party electoral fraud, Russia/Trump election meddling stateside are obvious.

rlctntgardener	2018-03-25 08:35	0	4	Yeah...you probably should care about Russia. This isn't about Russia 'rigging' the election in terms of ballot stuffing or electoral fraud - rather it is their influence through donations and social media propaganda that targeted voters. That is truly frightening.				977886740303269888	977855968364171264	nathanqgarza kiyirl	https://twitter.com/rlctntgardener/status/977886740303269888
