ThatsMyChad	2018-04-04 15:28	0	11	The biggest fish of my life. 21 years of fly fishing has lead to this 24 year old catching a 27” rainbow trout after a 37 minute fight. The man who taught me to walk in the river when I was 3, gets the first hug after it’s netted. I’m speechless pic.twitter.com/zbmx8xdwC6				981614431632158722			https://twitter.com/ThatsMyChad/status/981614431632158722	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZ9lFkKVQAA5S-o.jpg
