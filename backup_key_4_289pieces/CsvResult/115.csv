CurtisScoon	2018-07-17 20:51	36	62	These young idealistic, and oft time belligerent and offensive black people were unleashed on the black community via social media. Emboldened by the 1st "black" President they attacked black masculinity and "racism."

greenberg_byron	2018-07-12 20:53	0	0	I see many white people speaking out against racism on Twitter, on you tube and other social media. While it is true that most neo Nazis trumpsuckers are white, I don't see many black people calling out black racists.				1017572793108480000	1017232207180681216	groovyalien cstevens338	https://twitter.com/greenberg_byron/status/1017572793108480000

I guess they got tired of seeing white people acting a fool on social media and got excited.				1017149160838041601	1017099996804632577	KDVR	https://twitter.com/J_E_B_88/status/1017149160838041601	
jason_elliott	2018-07-07 10:42	0	0	I’m afraid this misses the point. Racism isn’t the novelty, calling it out on social media is. “The episode comes on the heels of a slew of similar cases in which white people complained to police about black people engaging in everyday activities” https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/us/pool-racial-profiling-white-man.html …				1015606952263446529			https://twitter.com/jason_elliott/status/1015606952263446529	
Thalia_Nyx	2018-07-06 10:42	12	92	I think black people have been harassed for as long as there's been a USA. Now, as you say, they can record it and with social media everyone can see it. It is hopefully opening eyes of white people that do not believe racism exists because it doesn't happen in front of them.				1015244559993847808	1015186212221579264	marcchoisnard LenHanes	https://twitter.com/Thalia_Nyx/status/1015244559993847808	
Do_RaeeeMi	2018-07-05 01:01	1	1	And there are white people who make “only white people” jokes... black people make “only black people jokes” It’s social media... it does not get that DEEP. Ppl really think racism is about words... like NO... this is systemic.

Left_Side_Drive	2018-07-01 09:20	0	1	I see a lot of white people, especially on social media, ordering black people to “stop making everything about race.” It’s disappointing how blind these people are that blacks are often defensive about race because they’re so regularly discriminated against w/ racism & bigotry.				1013412026591449088	1013198867159048194	usnehal MoniaWerlang	https://twitter.com/Left_Side_Drive/status/1013412026591449088	
thatcrazy1isnt	2018-06-29 06:10	0	0	Can anyone say it more clearly? Thanks to cellphones & social media it is visible today, but white people killing black people is something we’ve comfortably justified b/c it was police &we believed the police wouldn’t lie.

I know so many white people looking out for black people who are suffering. The problem is you see racism everyday and social media gives them idiots a huge stage				1009408748891226112	1009378292284129282	_Lwando_ FootballFunnnys	https://twitter.com/titomtimo/status/1009408748891226112

Before social media white people didn't believe there was racism and if it was not to the degree that people of color had being reporting.				1006782901638320128	1006729409699766272	skeletorramone1 SikhFeminist	https://twitter.com/KellyBo97062014/status/1006782901638320128

BRRN_Fed	2018-05-31 11:44	22	28	Social media feeds have been flush with "concerned" white people calling the police on their Black neighbors but this is more than mundane racism - police are part of the engine that drives gentrification and displacement.
