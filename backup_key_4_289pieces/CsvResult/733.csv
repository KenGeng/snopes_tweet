I hope he doesnt blame the Tories for lack of funding as he does with Police etc.				1020750222773891072	1020742940560412672	LondonDynaslow kramwkram	https://twitter.com/IrritantCab/status/1020750222773891072

RonnieChopra1	2018-07-20 05:04	2	1	Quite a few in the affluent parts of London but without UK number plates - mostly Qatari ones driven recklessly. One, in fact smashed into a parked car which then hit my car. Driver was drunk in his twenties yet the police did nothing.

ToyinO1	2018-07-20 02:22	0	0	So true Nick. A lot of people are getting away with crime due to lack of policing. Do you know how many car break ins in West london every Day in the last month? You report it and police don’t even turn up.

EbenTagoe	2018-07-19 17:17	0	0	The only way to combat these criminals using scooters on the streets of London, we need some of the policemen/women to start using motorbikes. This is just a common sense.
