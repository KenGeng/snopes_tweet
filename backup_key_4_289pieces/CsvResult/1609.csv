SandraBlackCat	2018-04-06 00:15	0	2	Ok, but I lived in Canada and Bears there did kill people. A Grizzly Bear in Alaska killed a photographer and his girlfriend and I suppose a polar bear attack must be pretty horrible.				982109457986478080	982019420179566592	Curly_Marlene crazyfan_page	https://twitter.com/SandraBlackCat/status/982109457986478080	
MG_Dilla	2018-03-13 05:55	3	9	Grizzly bears in Alaska and Canada are moving further North due to warming temperatures and as a consequence are coming into contact/mating with Polar Bears, thus creating a hybrid bear more adapted for the change in climate.

sharynNEWS	2018-03-08 13:33	0	0	There once was a bear in Alaska, which died - shot - young. part Grizzly & part Polar Bear (both usually very long distances away from each other) It had fish & nuts/berries, & squirrel in its' tummy found in autopsy. That's not supposed to happen - but it did. seen on @ NatGeo		@ NatGeo		971816274807402497			https://twitter.com/sharynNEWS/status/971816274807402497

jeffwhigdon	2018-01-13 11:28	0	1	Certainly possible. But grizzly bears are generally considered to be more aggressive than polar bears. In Alaska, grizzlies will drive polar bears away from whale carcasses, for example. I do think it's rare for a death like this to occur though!				952215851700191234	951532690439843841	TheSchidz	https://twitter.com/jeffwhigdon/status/952215851700191234

SnowTheBearCub	2017-12-02 10:59	0	1	True story. When I visited Alaska a park ranger gave me this advice for identifying the bears I might run into: If you climb a tree, and it climbs up too – it’s a Black Bear. if it shakes you out of the tree – it’s a Grizzly Bear. If there are no trees – it’s a Polar Bear. XD				936988277139230720	936985874700566528	APanserbjorn	https://twitter.com/SnowTheBearCub/status/936988277139230720
