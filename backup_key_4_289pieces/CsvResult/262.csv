webbbieone	2018-07-08 00:00	0	1	Fascinating creatures, they are. They exhibit emotional intelligence and curiosity not observed in many species. Funny, I’m watching Planet Earth: Blue Planet II on DirectTV RN. The dolphins are hanging/chatting with the killer whales...				1015807789430640640	1015441545552629760	Flipper628	https://twitter.com/webbbieone/status/1015807789430640640	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/2665.png

HussBanai	2018-06-20 14:52	0	2	# IRAESP first half was like watching a scene out of David Attenborough’s Planet Earth series where a pack of killer whales synchronously attempt to snatch a blue whale baby but are rebuffed through a combination of luck and exhaustive effort by the mother blue whale.			# IRAESP	1009509221933731842			https://twitter.com/HussBanai/status/1009509221933731842

nmdenoyer	2018-03-05 04:01	0	1	I was watching a program on NatGeo recently, and a pod of orcas were hunting a blue whale calf. The adult blue whales drove the orcas away, but it was intense. Killer whale, indeed.				970584958883516416			https://twitter.com/nmdenoyer/status/970584958883516416
