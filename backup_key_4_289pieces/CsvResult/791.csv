As rightly brought out of late it's the baser instincts of politicians &top echelons of Army that may be muddying the water on this front. Indian Military patterned on British Army Navy & Airforce is fine example of professionalism.				971040110316748800	970837483863846913	rwac48	https://twitter.com/captgrc/status/971040110316748800
