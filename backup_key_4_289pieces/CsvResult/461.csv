paracelsusrose	2018-07-13 02:07	0	0	Also I'm glad you don't know anyone full of hate but that doesn't mean they don't exist. People like Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence absolutely hate gay and trans people and would be happy to see them all die. It is very dangerous to ignore these facts.				1017651714881540096	1017627156334108672	paracelsusrose benpatrick90069	https://twitter.com/paracelsusrose/status/1017651714881540096

kellosian	2018-06-01 22:14	0	4	Alan Turing, a cryptographer in WWII, was castrated in 1952 by the UK for being gay. Mike Pence, current VP of the United States, believes gay couples signal "societal collapse". Christians today want to stone gay people, they're just afraid of being arrested.				1002735102793744384	1002722755794624513	labia_manora RespectableLaw	https://twitter.com/kellosian/status/1002735102793744384	
tomcoates	2018-05-26 15:00	0	1	Mike Pence and the Watchmen Pastors are actively campaigning against basic gay rights and equality, and spread anti-gay propaganda. The Vice President of the United States should not be connected with these people and all decent Americans should be horrified by these people.				1000451689474736128	1000111381956513792	tomcoates VP	https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1000451689474736128

upuouo	2018-05-14 10:26	0	0	This is Mike Pence the vice president of United states. He also hates gays and thinks women should be punished if they abort their child. He might very well be the President of US if Trump gets impeached which is more likely than ever. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/30/mike-pence-doesnt-dine-alone-with-other-women-and-were-all-shocked/?utm_term=.75b59a20f2da …				996033984231493632	995660351017504768	upuouo AmmarMaleki	https://twitter.com/upuouo/status/996033984231493632
