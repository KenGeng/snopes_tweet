No other books-he doesn’t read, Fox News on endless loop, all Trump products, gaudy gold gilded decor.				1020741797172006918	1020430567094046723	StephenAtHome	https://twitter.com/DianneGrubb/status/1020741797172006918

But the Governor had been in the game for years and had moved to statesman with ability to be a straight shooter, and he looks at me, jabs his finger in my chest, and says, "WIN!" or was that WHEN?				1018952326227382273	867029215652315137	MikeWebbNow eleeehhh	https://twitter.com/MikeWebbNow/status/1018952326227382273
