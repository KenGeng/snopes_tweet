You, on the other hand, have lied about Mexicans, Mexico paying for the wall, Stormy Danials payment, NFL players protests, not playing golf ever weekend, Russia’s attack, etc. etc.			# putinspuppet	1020657888799305728	1020642287725043712	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/jdr86498632/status/1020657888799305728

Kenlar333	2018-07-21 02:24	0	0	So it appears you've heard what Donald Trump said, not what he said. He didn't call "all" Mexicans criminals. He said "Mexico's Not Sending Us Their Best; Criminals, Drug Dealers And Rapists Are Crossing Border." https://www.infowars.com/i-live-in-jersey-and-trump-is-right-muslims-did-celebrate-on-911-in-nj-we-saw-it/ …				1020555126031843328	1019936133147516929	RobertRPottsJr1 13WJM	https://twitter.com/Kenlar333/status/1020555126031843328

GrumpyOldParty	2018-07-20 11:12	0	0	As usual, the left begins with a false premise. @ realDonaldTrump never said "Mexicans are rapists." he said "Mexico (as in the Mexican government) is sending rapists..." Big difference. It was that exact media distortion that firmly placed me in Trump's corner to begin with.		@ realDonaldTrump		1020325687813603328	1020046731776577536	JudgeJeanine TheView	https://twitter.com/GrumpyOldParty/status/1020325687813603328

RunMorgans	2018-07-20 04:56	0	1	He denounced Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers, he declared on camera that nothing good comes out of Mexico only drugs and crime. He called Africa and El Salvador shithole countries. He implies that migrants are MS-13. He imposed a measure he himself called a 'Muslim Ban'.				1020230948649136128	1019695583853010944	JustinFuriated stauken	https://twitter.com/RunMorgans/status/1020230948649136128
