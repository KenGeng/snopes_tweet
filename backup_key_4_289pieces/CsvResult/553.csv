jimwshoemaker	2018-07-19 08:25	0	0	The clearest indication that the @ GOP is bad for the United States is that a foreign government sought to use it, not the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to destabilize the nation.

TrumpDotDotDot	2018-07-18 17:44	23	136	JUST IN: The President of the United States implicitly equates the opposition Democratic party with a gang of savage killers. Americans remain unsurprised that the would-be autocrat believes Russia's dictator, Vladimir Putin, over the civil servants in the U.S. Intel community. pic.twitter.com/wuDMowQJL3				1019699574183784448	1019695889626083331	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/TrumpDotDotDot/status/1019699574183784448	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiazJfZX0AACbWv.jpg

The U.S. Democratic Party stormed and separated Ukraine from Russia, making it a war while advertising performance "Russia = evil", and robbed the vested interests of Ukraine. The villain is the United States Democratic Party.				1019511374907629568	1018943446583668736	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/FirstJpn/status/1019511374907629568

jordanvalallen	2018-07-16 22:10	0	1	The fact that Russia purposefully focused on race in its social media meddling speaks volumes. Russia knew that this shit was about race, yet Democratic leadership still can't admit it to this day.
