ksuoem	2018-06-20 16:57	4	1	Portable toilets and hand washing stations have been set up at ARC to provide closer bathroom and hand washing facilities for ARC residents. The water main break maintenance continues. We will update everyone as we get more information				1009540840488914944			https://twitter.com/ksuoem/status/1009540840488914944

Also what does this have to do with Starbucks letting people use their bathroom, somewhere the plot got lost.				1001597084095733760	1000888492237275138	MackinMelanie Catherine_AML	https://twitter.com/Oilybears/status/1001597084095733760

kilodelta	2018-05-11 11:23	0	0	A fun/smart trend we’ve been seeing out here is having one bathroom area with all the toilets are unisex but the hand washing area is shared. Basically doubles the number of toilets available for everyone, and is cheaper to build.				994961305344737281	994958556356136960	bryansuddith	https://twitter.com/kilodelta/status/994961305344737281

The cultural practices of foreigners (using water to clean themselves instead of toilet paper) has dangerous consequences as well.				988783880600682496	988779621134012418	FortuneMagazine	https://twitter.com/the_takingpictu/status/988783880600682496

drpablopistola	2018-04-01 16:46	1	0	In a Five Guys burger men’s bathroom, I heard a dude in the stall dropping bombs with loud splashdowns into the toilet. The stall door opened and a Five Guys employee walked out, and then he left the bathroom.

TXHomeNet	2017-12-26 11:05	0	1	In Tacoma, the city went to encampments and asked what people living there wanted. They wanted showers, bathrooms, and running water. So the city set up toilets and hand-washing stations, as part of a larger plan to address homelessness in their community. http://ow.ly/vIFA30hm9Pr				945686940896104449			https://twitter.com/TXHomeNet/status/945686940896104449
