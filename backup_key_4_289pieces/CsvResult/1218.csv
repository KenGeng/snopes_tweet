AlamanAbdulaziz	2018-07-17 17:41	0	0	Unlike killing wife or poisoning husband and committing crime, there is a option where a couple can separate. Do you know, the wife can initiate the process of divorce also known as Khulna from her husband ? Talaq is a misfortune for a Muslim man, according to the scriptures.				1019336352201048065	1018860576821448704	ridhima_at_wii	https://twitter.com/AlamanAbdulaziz/status/1019336352201048065
