sassybella10	2018-07-21 14:26	0	2	When will the President of the United States post tweets like... I cleaned the water up in Flint! Not a drop is dirty! I destroyed a golf course and built homes for the homeless where they once were!

KarKettler	2018-07-20 19:11	0	0	As president of the United States, don't you have better things to do? Or is your entire presidency just an interruption of your golf game? You clearly don't have a high enough IQ to understand that the players were kneeling to draw attention to the killing of black men by police				1020446060584423424	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/KarKettler/status/1020446060584423424

joesanders33	2018-07-18 22:17	0	2	It’s hard. In that case I laid out how absurd it is for an old billionaire with lots of hotels & golf courses & such to become PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES willing to sell state secrets or do stuff for Russia in exchange for having a hotel green lit.

hohumtweets	2018-07-18 09:44	0	1	Yep, Trump had no business being in Scotland other than to use the Office of the President of the United States to promote one of his golf courses and a brave Secret Service member died in the process. KARMA will certainly be a bitch for Trump.				1019578573030453248	1019559055394828288	Luvmycountry777 dbongino WalshFreedom	https://twitter.com/hohumtweets/status/1019578573030453248
