mikozlowski	2018-07-05 16:00	0	0	Yes, @ realDonaldTrump needs to reunite the children with their parents NOW. He has the power of the United States government. They can reunite the children with their parents. We can all do this with DNA tests, social media, word of mouth... no child left behind # MAGA # Resistance		@ realDonaldTrump	# MAGA # Resistance	1014962142020284416	1014945843089035264	MichaelAvenatti	https://twitter.com/mikozlowski/status/1014962142020284416

jim_pennington	2018-04-18 06:39	0	1	Yes people you are correct. This is a tweet on social media from the President of the United States attempting to discredit a porn star who he screwed days after his 3rd wife gave birth to his 5th child. Trumps has always failed to take responsibility for his actions. pic.twitter.com/b4f5OVW8kZ				986554925122506753	986547093610299392	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/jim_pennington/status/986554925122506753	
Wooonderboy	2018-02-20 19:30	0	0	@ realDonaldTrump please delete your Twitter... a president of the United States shouldn't be on social media complaining so damn much... learn to brush shit off and move on and fix this broken nation instead of complaing about bs online... you are acting like an insecure child...		@ realDonaldTrump		966107942314487808			https://twitter.com/Wooonderboy/status/966107942314487808	
humanisthobbit	2018-01-02 22:01	0	0	Never, never in the history of the United States has a President gone on social media to brag about the size of our nuclear arsenal and belittle one world leader after another. @ realDonaldTrump is a selfish, condescending child with no concept what class is.		@ realDonaldTrump		948388815948996608			https://twitter.com/humanisthobbit/status/948388815948996608	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1013263031755829248/-6TjsOol_normal.jpg
PDMADMZ	2017-11-30 12:36	0	0	Well social media is f***ing up everyone, even the ones that are already f***ed up, It’s so cringey seeing how the freaking president of the United States is using nicknames for the leaders of other countries, you’re THE president not a child.				936287825099620353	936209447747190784	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/PDMADMZ/status/936287825099620353	
AlexisBroussar9	2017-11-22 03:25	0	0	This is very childish and petty... As the President of the United States of America. You reflect on all American people. We try teach our kids not to run to social media saying rude hurtful things as a child would. A person whom does things out of good will never speak on it..				933250099622195201	932392209445457920	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/AlexisBroussar9/status/933250099622195201	
tomdevastator	2017-11-20 06:00	0	0	How about instead of being a petulant child about his response you rise above it like the adult you're supposed to be (let alone the president of the United States) and leave it off social media? You're literally acting like a bitchy schoolgirl.				932564327994970113	932303108146892801	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/tomdevastator/status/932564327994970113	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f602.png
