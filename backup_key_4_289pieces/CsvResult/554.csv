DDanny110	2018-07-21 15:44	0	1	I'll save a lot of you some time. That IS in fact the actual screenshot of Google images when you search "idiot". BONUS: TRUMP takes the first 34 of 35 results. His string is broken, understandably, by Kanye West.				1020756493103222787	1020642287725043712	AJemaineClement realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/DDanny110/status/1020756493103222787	
bobbyedgar	2018-07-21 14:25	3	38	But to answer your question, just go screenshot any given tweet by @ realDonaldTrump. It will make no sense and add no value.		@ realDonaldTrump		1020736579348836354	1020642287725043712	ContiTonight realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/bobbyedgar/status/1020736579348836354

seanofalaska	2018-07-21 13:21	0	1	I don't have the screenshots but a moderator on r/the_donald was arguing with a redditor. He claimed they were forming a secret 3rd political party called the Russian/American party and Trump was their leader.				1020720457023029248	1020719707979243520	ericgarland	https://twitter.com/seanofalaska/status/1020720457023029248

Heatman81	2018-07-21 12:18	0	0	Then link the video. You’re expecting me to know exactly where that screenshot came from. The Don Jr meeting proved nothing. It lasted 5 seconds and amounted to nothing so stfu and do some research. For help curing your trump derangement, I’d suggest consulting an expert.				1020704463819018240	1020432499082702849	mademarest realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/Heatman81/status/1020704463819018240	
CFayz	2018-07-21 11:48	0	3	What happens to all the celebrities, politicians,any public figure that has bashed @ realDonaldTrump since before he was Inaugurated? When they realize they've been tricked (maybe they're complicit),that Trump did nothing wrong? We'll see.

WalesFern	2018-07-21 10:43	0	0	19 hours before this tweet, you claimed that, far from it being 'almost unheard of', and 'perhaps illegal', the it had in fact been YOUR idea to record the conversation. However, before I was able to take a screenshot to attach a copy here, you deleted the tweet.				1020680744228872192	1020642287725043712	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/WalesFern/status/1020680744228872192

AngieTrombley	2018-07-21 09:16	0	0	If I go through the last decade of # DonaldTrump’s tweets and screenshot/share the ones that are inappropriate/distasteful, can we get him fired too? Wait. I forgot we don’t hold the President to the same standards we do TV personalities, directors, actors, musicians or athletes.			# DonaldTrump	1020658861102034945			https://twitter.com/AngieTrombley/status/1020658861102034945
