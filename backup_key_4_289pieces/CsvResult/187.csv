Remember free secondary education (turns out was false), more students intake, day scholars in selected national schools, books direct to schools, increased capitation etc. Nothing wrong with one being concerned about preparedness.				947066315742654464	946994904701587456	kamaujst NdunguWainaina	https://twitter.com/RKI2011/status/947066315742654464
