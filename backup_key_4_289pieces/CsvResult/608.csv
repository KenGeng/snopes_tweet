DeLoachJW	2018-07-21 12:23	0	1	The tale is one of humans, human nature & sin (or whatever your belief system calls it). Cavemen conquered/enslaved/stole enemy tribes; African indigenous same; South/Central/North America same; Asia same. Africa and it’s residents/descendants are no better/worse than any other.				1020705896530415620	1020597495704014848	CurtisScoon	https://twitter.com/DeLoachJW/status/1020705896530415620

vetrissimo	2018-07-21 05:25	0	0	Yes England is the only racist and imperialist country in the world !! (not according to people from French Africa btw) We are solely responsible for slavery even though it was practised by African tribes, Arabs and most other cultures for thousands of years.				1020600549241237511	1020580505618649088	MaxSylvan	https://twitter.com/vetrissimo/status/1020600549241237511

Habbash	2018-07-21 04:10	0	0	To all black Nationalist how are Afrikaaners not locals as they have in South Africa since 1652 much before many bantu tribes and they during the early periods inter married with blacks thus forming the South African colored community or mix race community.				1020581660184797185			https://twitter.com/Habbash/status/1020581660184797185	
TowardsUhuru	2018-07-21 04:09	0	1	Guys please stop referring to an “African culture” or labelling certain practices as unAfrican. Africa is a massive continent with thousands of different tribes, each with its own norms and practices. We don’t all do what you and your people do. Oh and culture is not static!				1020581552210817024			https://twitter.com/TowardsUhuru/status/1020581552210817024	
jittaun	2018-07-21 02:47	0	0	U must understand how West/Central African culture works to understand how Afro American culture operates. Africa is a VERY diverse place and tribes are genetically distinct enough that they have their own look not to mention culture. That didn't go away just bc they left Africa.				1020560885671256065	1019685232595951616	jittaun TwoDicksandMike	https://twitter.com/jittaun/status/1020560885671256065	
BoyzieMzamo	2018-07-21 00:21	0	1	Honestly speaking we sort of follow the Same principles...It is as if all these tribes in Africa were derived from one core rule which is Ubuntu(Humanity). Africans are all the Same culturally we perform almost similar rituals with a bit of variations there and there.				1020524142364372992	1020318868961710080	marva_renae	https://twitter.com/BoyzieMzamo/status/1020524142364372992

mstamp36	2018-07-20 17:24	0	1	@ MatthewOldridge I know u r a Marvel fan like me. The only question I had in Black Panther is when they went to the mountain tribe for help. Wakanda is fake but modelled after Africans countries. There is no mountains in Africa with that much snow nor that high correct?

justcallmeBABA	2018-07-20 10:18	1	1	That's cool, but I grew up in Africa and have visited 7-10 African countries in East, West, North AND South Africa. This is my experience. Cultural norms depend on where you go within certain countries. Different areas, tribes, families etc. Africa isn't a monolith. https://twitter.com/shewshew__/status/1020295907479351297 …				1020312079927054343			https://twitter.com/justcallmeBABA/status/1020312079927054343	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/981485008119623680/qu5-gh2b_normal.jpg
