They are a banned group by our Government because they show the truth about the Muslims in our Country & in Europe. Our Government do not want any truth about Islam and call it Islamophobia.		@ realDonaldTrump		956866313288380416			https://twitter.com/lesterjoh1/status/956866313288380416

Also, only muslims are calling Britain First a hate group. Yet cry Islamophobia if someone calls Islam a hate group or terrorists.
