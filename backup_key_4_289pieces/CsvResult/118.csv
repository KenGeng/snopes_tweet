NoahCuree	2018-03-24 23:50	0	2	Those 7% of teachers should have the right to carry if they wish to do so. No one has said that all teachers have to carry a firearm. After a school shooting in Israel in 1974 teachers were allowed to have access to firearms and since then only two such shootings have occurred				977754469134979073	977729786524119040	heather_kris KyleKashuv POTUS	https://twitter.com/NoahCuree/status/977754469134979073	
dhart2001	2018-03-08 10:55	0	0	If they want to "beef up security", they should do it like Israel does. One armed security at school entrance (with EXTENSIVE firearm training). NO armed teachers. Total gun control (EXTENSIVE background checks, MANDATORY firearm training, etc.) They maintain serious protection.				971776540571615233	971766503426097152	nytimes	https://twitter.com/dhart2001/status/971776540571615233

WarWolfActual	2018-02-24 07:07	0	1	There's only 3.6 million teachers employed across the U.S., not 5 million. Secondly, were talking about those licensed to concealed carry be allowed to carry in school. They already have the license and the firearm. I personally know of 3! Israel successfully did it, why not us?				967370493220343808	966855537085296640	RobbyTheremin RealJack ireneandrade10	https://twitter.com/WarWolfActual/status/967370493220343808	
ShadiqUnique	2018-02-22 11:07	0	0	Since Israel made it mandatory for all teachers to carry a firearm, there school shootings have plummeted to exactly 0 every year. it’s nearly impossible to track down and collect 400 million (registered) guns. But it’s very easy to give every teacher in the us a firearm. pic.twitter.com/G0ZOO2ycNe				966706096462114816	966703855177256960	shofu realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/ShadiqUnique/status/966706096462114816	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWpuEKYW0AAt8Wj.jpg
budfoxnole	2018-02-21 23:47	0	3	Moron. 911 response time is an average of 11 minutes. I think if I were a teacher (and my wife is) I would like the CHOICE to carry a firearm to protect myself and my students. Israel trains their teachers, and all school shootings have ceased. Don’t let facts get in the way.				966534785500876802	966512605807378433	ryanstruyk	https://twitter.com/budfoxnole/status/966534785500876802

grillnguy	2018-02-21 20:37	0	0	You want policies that keep kids safe in school? Then have a look at Israel. Give teachers and educators the ability to have the training and availability of a firearm close at hand. This will be the ONLY thing that would give em a chance at safety. # armedteacers			# armedteacers	966487179240361984	966376433735143424	FoxNews	https://twitter.com/grillnguy/status/966487179240361984

Firearm ownership is best/dispersed. Teacher concealed carry/ Armed security at schools would eliminate school attacks... does in Israel.				965198968471916545	965186288063102977	RareJedhi	https://twitter.com/BeachOfNormandy/status/965198968471916545

Dmitrifg1	2018-02-16 00:16	0	0	Or maybe every teacher should have a firearm of some sort in the classroom in a safe. It would make School safer. We need to start being like Israel. They haven’t had a school shooting or a hijacking. Their security is much more safer and schools allow teachers to carry guns.				964367928660434945	963918936432574464	YBPLive YourAnonNews	https://twitter.com/Dmitrifg1/status/964367928660434945
