DozTweets	2018-07-20 18:22	0	3	LOL! Do crisis merchants understand how hard it would be to just stop being an NRL fan and go follow another code? You really think Barry from Western Sydney is gonna go follow the “airial ping pong”, “round ball game” or “rahrah”...nah..me either. https://twitter.com/marklevy2gb/status/1020254835407347712 …				1020433669993914369			https://twitter.com/DozTweets/status/1020433669993914369	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1019518055196475392/orueT3Rv_normal.jpg
IjustHadToDoIt	2018-07-19 22:17	0	4	You ever play ping-pong, Joey? You remind me of the ball. Remember the video game breakout, you remind me of the ball there too. Darn, too many ball references. My bad, don't want to get you started on that, do we?				1020130531114090496	1020122981681508352	JoeyTM3	https://twitter.com/IjustHadToDoIt/status/1020130531114090496

jesse_hallock	2018-07-18 15:31	0	0	@ OrangenoseTweet Jeff Chen was right on when he said “I made this game too easy.” I didn’t lose one match.... beat the game in 15 minutes. Up the difficulty please. Every player after Ping Pong King feels the same. Need longer rallies and less time to react to the ball. pic.twitter.com/eZTMgECOFl		@ OrangenoseTweet		1019665967641636865			https://twitter.com/jesse_hallock/status/1019665967641636865	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiaUyY_V4AAxflH.jpg

TheMiddle123	2018-07-17 11:32	0	0	The ping pong ball just wants to survive the game. Blaming it for the player's swings is not quite fair.				1019243376971952128	1019241968973570049	ChemiShalev	https://twitter.com/TheMiddle123/status/1019243376971952128

But last night I had a dream I was delivering a baby while playing a game of soccer with a ping pong ball.
