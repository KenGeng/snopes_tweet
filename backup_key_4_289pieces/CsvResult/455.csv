You rip parents from children with no regard. And we she care that Don Jr is getting divorced.

NDSU_02	2018-07-10 23:32	0	0	Okay but this does not matter one bit until you compare to a chart of another president that's like eating the same flavor of ice cream all your life and then saying it is the best flavor (sorry to use a childish analogy but it was the first I could come up with)				1016887844852387840	1014295751814533120	lindachilders1 rizzio123	https://twitter.com/NDSU_02/status/1016887844852387840

Remsendoc	2018-06-28 23:03	0	1	Donnie boy, you're just feeling antsy because you can see that Mueller's getting close to making his case against you. Your prison sentence will lock you up for 200 years. So, calm down, and have some ice cream, while you can still choose the flavor that you want.				1012531860780355584	1012315534220808192	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/Remsendoc/status/1012531860780355584

Lucas_Marest	2018-06-24 15:53	0	0	I got your point, but invalidating the points on what you call the "crutch lists" is not fair. It's like asking someone which flavor of ice cream they prefer but not the popular ones, if it's popular, there might be a reason.				1010974309253287936	1010873383087636480	WellerLaurie jnnfrl	https://twitter.com/Lucas_Marest/status/1010974309253287936
