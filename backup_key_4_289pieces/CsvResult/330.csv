fuzzybleu	2018-07-18 15:32	3	11	Here's an idea. Let's all send letters of protest to the White House. If you have an issue with the President, I don't care if you are from the United States or not, send a letter & say so. Let's fill the place up with snail mail: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC, 20500.				1019666349121994752			https://twitter.com/fuzzybleu/status/1019666349121994752

Ehbg22	2018-05-28 15:01	0	0	The letter should not have gone out with so many errors. Regardless of the proper or improper capitalization of the word nation, the White House should write a proper letter, especially if the President of the United States is putting his name in it.				1001176623285235712	1001114673381601282	tribelaw realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/Ehbg22/status/1001176623285235712

dpmoran1962	2018-05-26 21:34	0	1	It does not speak well for the teacher who had. A President of the United States would dictate a letter, he would not type nor write it himself. The teacher ought to have been thankful the White House answered, thus what she did is just appalling.				1000550812119126016	1000549918799552513	dcexaminer	https://twitter.com/dpmoran1962/status/1000550812119126016
