SumErgoMonstro	2018-06-08 16:15	0	0	@ WecallhimROD About an hour before the tornado hit Topeka, the storm dropped one on Manhattan. We lost some shingles off our roof and our lawn mower was lifted over the fence and dropped a few houses up the hill (got a call from the neighbor and I went to get it)....		@ WecallhimROD		1005181502609592321			https://twitter.com/SumErgoMonstro/status/1005181502609592321	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/659591046569947136/BPa95Ziw_normal.png

During a tornado warning only a few miles from the system, I found this man sitting in a lawn mower in the middle of the road drinking a beer.

Remember coming to the top of a hill, and looking down in a valley to what looked like a giant lawn mower had gone through, in fact a Tornado. Very scary scene.				991868185791123458	991803882501177344	fuzzybleu	https://twitter.com/harry_fosters/status/991868185791123458

bendapplegate	2018-05-01 23:19	0	0	@ NewsOn6 Slowing down is the key to no tornados. She was ripping through here on that dang lawn mower. Worse than the old manager who use to do the same dang thing. Then he'd blare that tornado siren like his life was ending.

SwiftSorority13	2018-03-05 23:50	0	0	My cat doesn't like the snow blower much less the lawn mower so for his safety and comfort I'm keeping him indoors at home while they clean up.
