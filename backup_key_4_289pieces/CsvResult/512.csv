Just_A_Pilgrim_	2018-07-16 05:32	0	1	I would be interested to know what action the police take against LGBT activists when they graffiti churches, threaten violent attacks including rape and arson. The hate that Asher's bakery has faced, hate videos against the Salvation army, all because they won't say gay is ok.				1018790455616602112	1018419925591961600	theweeflea ancresbyjacq	https://twitter.com/Just_A_Pilgrim_/status/1018790455616602112	
TheCheesyChin	2018-07-08 22:37	0	0	The Salvation Army is tax payer funded. It is religiously based (hello 1st amendment), and has an abhorrent track record of discrimination against the LGBT community. Its CEO has been quoted as saying he’d refuse service to an injured, dying gay person.				1016149194241986560	1016135548312797185	justiceorkarma	https://twitter.com/TheCheesyChin/status/1016149194241986560	
_queenkarma	2018-06-16 15:06	0	1	They fund various anti-LGBT organizations like FCA & the salvation army that opposes same sex marriage, support anti-LGBT housing discrimination & gay conversion therapy, which btw is still legal in most states. But how dare LGBT people try to defend ourselves, right?				1008063297034309632	1008062268385439746	EricDJuly	https://twitter.com/_queenkarma/status/1008063297034309632	
JacobKai13	2018-04-15 21:14	0	1	The Coachella Dude hates gays. I love how nobody cares and will still throw hundreds of dollars into it, but are the same type who throw a fit over other Anti LGBT run orgamizations like Salvation Army or Chic Fil A.				985687758655098886			https://twitter.com/JacobKai13/status/985687758655098886	
lovesfiercely	2018-02-15 07:13	0	1	And will they still support a child with all those FREE goodies if the child is gay or trans? Because the Salvation Army is a Christian organization and turns away members of the LGBT community all the time.				964110503730561024	963897178228973574	TwiterusMaximus DrCollins10	https://twitter.com/lovesfiercely/status/964110503730561024	
shrikex0r	2018-01-25 20:53	0	1	Please don't. The Salvation Army are virulently anti-lgbt, and particularly anti-trans; they routinely kick trans women back out onto the street. There's numerous accounts of this; for now, here's an SA official saying gays should be killed. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/salvation-army-official-gays-deserve-death/321193/ …				956706560721342466	956474169482498048	StmblngBlockhed Ariana_Tobin	https://twitter.com/shrikex0r/status/956706560721342466	
alonectorch	2018-01-20 20:20	0	2	friendly reminder to fact-check and update your news: while the salvation army has an anti-LGBT history, the lobbying stopped in 2015, and the gay employees thing stopped in 2013. Since 2015, the @ SalvationArmyUS has no ties to anti-LGBT organizations.		@ SalvationArmyUS		954886441531781121	934235902057914368	TheCoffeeSnolf	https://twitter.com/alonectorch/status/954886441531781121	
NoahDavis_Power	2018-01-03 06:05	0	2	And Paddy, I understand the Salvation Army does good deeds. I would be willfully blind to say otherwise. However, it is well documented that the Salvation Army has rejected those who both support and who are a part of the LGBT community - they don't upfront ask if you're gay.				948510700930060288	948206224339849217	thefutureyousee VOCMOpenline	https://twitter.com/NoahDavis_Power/status/948510700930060288

DRT843	2017-12-27 21:25	2	4	the salvation army is bullshit about helping homeless youth. The majority of youth that are homeless are LGBT+ and The Salvation Army openly does not support the gay community so the majority of these homeless youth are being oppressed by a company claiming to help them				946205419126624257			https://twitter.com/DRT843/status/946205419126624257	
SnowflakeWhite	2017-12-24 09:19	0	3	Why post a picture of the salvation army then? They discriminate against the LGBT community in the bell ringers they employ.
