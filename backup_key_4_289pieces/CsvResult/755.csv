BaltFang	2018-03-26 10:03	1	6	I can't believe how many Democrats still believe the Russian hack the GE. Put yet we all know what they Did to @ BernieSanders in every state and yet the Democratic party keeps saying they didn't cheat and rig the primaries and Caucus states.

JimmyPeteJr	2018-02-18 20:02	0	2	Did Russia screw around with the Nevada caucus? Maybe they were the ones throwing chairs. And the superdelegates? The Democratic Party answered the question in court.

Lee_in_Iowa	2017-12-08 18:59	4	3	Caucuses are very porous. The Bernie bros openly planned on Reddit to come into Iowa and Nevada in vanloads, register, and caucus. Democratic party locals, afraid to offend possibly real voters, did not require IDs. So it was actually CAUCUSES that were RIGGED.				939283399931555840	796878196180271104	yottapoint	https://twitter.com/Lee_in_Iowa/status/939283399931555840
