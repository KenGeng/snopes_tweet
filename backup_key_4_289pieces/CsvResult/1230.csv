Surfpapi	2018-07-02 21:41	0	1	Military service is definitely a family affair. A Soldier is only as strong as the spouse, the child, the Mother and Father or other loved one, who stands with and behind him/her. At times the home front can be as challenging as the Tip of the Spear.				1013960942726668288	1013957481515581441	mosbacher_mica	https://twitter.com/Surfpapi/status/1013960942726668288

Electrocution and raping a child in front his father the fuck wrong with these so call soldiers.

Let the bankers, politicians, and welfare queens in the military industrial complex worship dead soldiers. I'm sure the founding Americans wouldn't have done the same.				1001180941522522112	1001055932376387584	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/MiaCMitch/status/1001180941522522112	
Rev_Spooky	2018-05-10 01:39	0	0	I watched your testimony as a child as my retired military father explained how you had no honor or integrity. He explained how you were the worst sort of traitor to our country. An abject disgrace to the uniform. He was a decorated soldier who survived Vietnam & Korea.				994451766958870528	993568014208552960	Rev_Spooky NRA OliverLNorth	https://twitter.com/Rev_Spooky/status/994451766958870528	
scottyknight94	2018-03-23 16:22	0	0	How can you say that, as a "child of the military" Why do you think a soldier would purposely harm their mother, father, brother and child if it came down to it?				977279487695040512	977219924866322432	RandomlyJenn aj_schweigert	https://twitter.com/scottyknight94/status/977279487695040512

Mama_Mandria	2018-01-03 23:23	0	0	My oldest just registered for the draft and my second will in 7 months. I am terrified. I’m the child of a sailor and my father-in-law was AF. I believe in military service and protecting those who need it. But DT’s dick pride is not worth sending our soldiers to battle.				948771771951480832	948370375359987712	davidfrum	https://twitter.com/Mama_Mandria/status/948771771951480832	
A_Silent_Child	2017-12-05 15:51	0	0	My mom's father was in the Navy for his career. His wife was a stay at home mother, as was common those days! However, my grandfather's mother beat some gender stereotypes by also working in the military! As a secretary and then translator though, she couldn't be a soldier!				938148963777175552	934884038359244800	FindusPancake	https://twitter.com/A_Silent_Child/status/938148963777175552	
BadPHXManager	2017-12-03 00:41	0	0	Both things are disrespectful. I was in the military, and all the males on my father's side. As a child I watched soldiers bodies come home covered in those flags. My father almost died in Vietnam and lost his best friend fighting for the flag, I've nearly died for the flag				937194944862629888	935289734682722304	wokeluisa LongJosh	https://twitter.com/BadPHXManager/status/937194944862629888
