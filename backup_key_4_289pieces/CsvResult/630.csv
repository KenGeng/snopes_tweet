NYTransitMuseum	2018-07-15 11:01	6	16	In 1962, the Newspaper Comics Council ran a subway-themed ad campaign promoting its roster of syndicated cartoonists, including Milton Caniff (on the far right). Some of these cartoons are # NowOnView at the # NYTransitMuseum in # UndergroundHeroes: NY Transit in the Comics. pic.twitter.com/f10ZmG7rDy			# NowOnView # NYTransitMuseum # UndergroundHeroes	1018510753886867457			https://twitter.com/NYTransitMuseum/status/1018510753886867457	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiJ6IXkVAAAU-YH.jpg

LetItMelo	2018-06-21 11:02	0	0	I think the newspaper is the barrier. Most kids know Garfield through cartoons and branding. Plus the comic isn't the business anymore (the brand is). He's kind of an Anti Hello Kitty. Davis also seems to be "over" comics. He's credited as the sole writer of Garfield Gets Real: pic.twitter.com/abcesC8fw2				1009813820037107714	1009806682967429120	akpruitt	https://twitter.com/LetItMelo/status/1009813820037107714	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgOUCSAV4AcE9PN.jpg

WednesdayComix	2018-06-06 14:35	3	10	One only needs to look at the political cartoons featured before the turn of the 20th century & currently in a newspaper or magazine near you. THAT is one of the origins of the medium. For the last 90+ years or so politics have been debated sequentially in # comics books/strips. pic.twitter.com/XQeMdUl6Kn			# comics	1004431499817562113	1004413248521699328	JamesGavsie ebonstorm	https://twitter.com/WednesdayComix/status/1004431499817562113	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfB1Hy8VAAANp9V.jpg
