BarnOwlTrust	2018-06-26 08:52	6	17	The Stock Dove is Amber listed on the UK Red List for Birds and can nest in Barn Owl boxes. They suffered from the effects of organochlorine seed-dressings that were used in the 50’s and 60’s, but now the UK holds over 20% of European breeding population. pic.twitter.com/J1z41Fxisq				1011593030091051009			https://twitter.com/BarnOwlTrust/status/1011593030091051009	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dgnmf0HVAAA4Wyq.jpg

TweetsByRuth	2018-04-01 17:42	0	1	Lots of birds of prey around here too. Always have nesting barn owls, few family of buzzards in the woods opposite, Hawks, and plenty of Red Kites. I'm very lucky to be here, surrounded by farms, river, mountains, woods, meadows, and some common land for miles.				980561043104653313	980542360567283713	ZwartblesIE	https://twitter.com/TweetsByRuth/status/980561043104653313	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/2764.png
