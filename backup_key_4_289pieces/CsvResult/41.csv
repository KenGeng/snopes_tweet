Typically 20% from ex-EU, most within EU.				1020803707552829440	1020785667134099458	MSmithsonPB	https://twitter.com/El__Sid/status/1020803707552829440

RunMorgans	2018-07-21 17:58	0	0	Germany has a budget surplus. Those numbers explain the trade deficit. Before I get to the trade deficit formula, German carmakers alone have created 110.000 American jobs. The reason why American cars do not sell in Europe is that they are not suited for the market.				1020790117039071232	1017018643756998661	PaulCarl12Carl hsehenuk J___K__________	https://twitter.com/RunMorgans/status/1020790117039071232	
BenPummell	2018-07-21 17:58	1	0	Funnily enough, you can't make threats to Germany about their car manufacturers, or Frances cheese producers, or Italy's vineyards. You can't from your obligations just because you're Britain. It's not 1910 anymore and some people are about to get an incredibly rude awakening.				1020790089079840768			https://twitter.com/BenPummell/status/1020790089079840768
