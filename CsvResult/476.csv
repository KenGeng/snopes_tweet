IndyK58	2018-02-22 22:23	3	6	I think when it was written, they assumed future Americans would be smart enough(were they wrong?) to adjust a 200+ year old document to fit that future world. They couldn't predict what exactly would be available in the future. They did a really good job with the framework.				966876046908895232	961982655763017729	MasonsMemah AsperGirl	https://twitter.com/IndyK58/status/966876046908895232
