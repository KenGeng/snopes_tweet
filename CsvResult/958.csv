The United States is much better off without him, @ BarackObama, @ HillaryClinton , @ JamesComeyFBI , and the rest of the crooked Democratic Party. # RepublicansMustVote		@ JohnBrennan @ BarackObama @ HillaryClinton @ JamesComeyFBI	# RepublicansMustVote	1021032964883451904	1020465683228835840	ScottAdamsSays KimStrassel WSJopinion	https://twitter.com/cristysisler/status/1021032964883451904

EXCEPT if it were Barack Obama and/or Hillary Clinton. Rubio INTERACTED with Trump? Maybe he should've reached across the aisle years ago.				1021023403673899009			https://twitter.com/gingermae333/status/1021023403673899009

You are racist and a sexual predator. You are inept and stupid. You enable the worst of our society. # FUCKtrump			# FUCKtrump	1021018031064059904	1020642287725043712	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/Blueskyfox/status/1021018031064059904
