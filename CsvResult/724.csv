Show me one instance where money donated for the so called Cecil cause was used for conservation. Trophy hunting is the only way to protect and sustainably conserve lions.				1019887340964208640	1019589089161613312	Blood_Lions Traveller24_SA	https://twitter.com/SeanMil32532027/status/1019887340964208640

ManicomioCity	2018-07-16 06:05	0	0	The killing of Cecil the lion in 2015 exposed the blood sport of trophy hunting to the world. Trophy hunting is extremely cruel and exacerbates the decline of many species. It must end. http://bit.ly/2Jr5zlZ pic.twitter.com/tJ1zqKV7EX				1018798651999707137			https://twitter.com/ManicomioCity/status/1018798651999707137	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiN_-V5XcAAJ5-d.jpg

ZackeryDaley	2018-07-05 02:11	0	0	remember when the media freaked out about Cecil the lion, so people stopped hunting lions. which caused the lion population to becme to large, leading to the culling of hundreds of lions in Zimbabwe directly due to lack of trophy hunting. good job hippies! https://africageographic.com/blog/lion-culling-paradox-banning-trophy-hunting/ …				1014753495235289089	1014161581498826752	historylvrsclub	https://twitter.com/ZackeryDaley/status/1014753495235289089	
becsscott	2018-07-04 09:25	0	16	This week marks three years since Cecil the lion was gunned down by trophy hunters, sparking global outrage. And we must continue to be outraged. We must continue to push and lobby to end trophy hunting – a practice that *categorically* has no place in today's world.				1014500359279128578			https://twitter.com/becsscott/status/1014500359279128578

joemorin3	2018-07-02 16:32	0	1	Cecil did not die in vain. He is bringing attention to the the perverse economics of trophy hunting.
