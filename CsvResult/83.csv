She had winged a massive brown snake and phoned us to bring more shells, as she had run out. Country girls are tough.				1019194814795878400	1019037822328582146	MelbourneBitter	https://twitter.com/Corner0fAwesome/status/1019194814795878400	
Cr4zyL3gzz	2018-07-14 02:05	0	3	Has this "J. Kiefer"ever jumped a pit full of snakes with a surrounding ring of fire on a girls 10 speed Murray bike? Ever orchestrated a neighborhood lawn mower Roman candle fight? Ever shot a bull in the ass with a BB gun point blank just to see who could reach the fence first?				1018013572381708288	1018010948077064192		https://twitter.com/Cr4zyL3gzz/status/1018013572381708288	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/846058654008840192/vXuu0AIS_normal.jpg

The girl gently stroked his stomach while watching the man, pride in her heart over her pet, Clay was almost magical.

Morgyzilla	2018-05-27 12:57	0	3	Yesterday I was in a bit of a tizzy. I found a baby and a larger gardener snake ravaged by a lawn mower. I thought my favorite big friendly girl was one of the victims. But this morning I was pleased to find her sunbathing and slithering around, alive and well . pic.twitter.com/9NZGxFCKSb				1000783028539584512			https://twitter.com/Morgyzilla/status/1000783028539584512	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f49c.png
ramdonomo	2018-05-20 12:19	0	0	Aww! I had a garter snake for a pet as a little girl... for like a day. Couldn't figure out how he got out of the cardboard box on our porch. Then my mom mowed the lawn and I was horrified.				998236729646575616	997911215123787776	howiecohen	https://twitter.com/ramdonomo/status/998236729646575616
