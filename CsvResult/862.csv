bad_leaf	2018-07-23 11:15	2	3	I would ageee with you, except that socialism is not extreme. Communism is extreme. Socialism is Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, etc. There was a time when America was close to adopting socialism. The 1910s through 1930s. It was violently put down by wealthy interests.				1021413477343117314	1021132108381683712	DorothySchulze4 pineyus	https://twitter.com/bad_leaf/status/1021413477343117314
