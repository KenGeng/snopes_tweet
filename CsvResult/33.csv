DankDerpJr	2018-06-04 10:24	5	14	After this b******* false racism charge I no longer shop at Starbucks and instead and I'm now visiting local coffee houses. We do not need separate sets of rules for people of color versus white people.				1003643580555153408	1001405260995346433	Starbucks	https://twitter.com/DankDerpJr/status/1003643580555153408

Only time I've ever dealt with racism in my face was working at Starbucks and some lady getting pissed that a Spanish person made her coffee. https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/996725747711541249 …				996799352785068034			https://twitter.com/studiomogura/status/996799352785068034	https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/996724592583430146/img/7nd7HsFSGwdeywEK.jpg

I would have been hard pressed not to go off on somebody like that.
