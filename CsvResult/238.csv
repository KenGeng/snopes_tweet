BeerPOTUS	2018-07-20 12:21	0	0	So if straight actors aren't allowed to play gay characters does that mean gay actors aren't allowed to play straight characters or is there a double standard?				1020342904009707520	1019975093102043136	WklySubstandard	https://twitter.com/BeerPOTUS/status/1020342904009707520

It is the entire basis of celebrity endorsement in marketing. You like the person's work/looks etc. & many conflate actors & characters they play.				1020322224044208129	1020301631710167040	DonalTDeLay	https://twitter.com/Going_Sane/status/1020322224044208129

She is the best internet mom, and is amazing in all she does. I wish you the best in your move to Vegas!		@ IzanamiVA		1020320857749622784	1020297859650990081	PyrOMG	https://twitter.com/spenctheoldtaco/status/1020320857749622784

In fact, i think that’s unbelievably cool as it wasnt too long ago when we didnt even have internet where you could even talk to your favourite actors.				1020319091528122369	1020315954666823680	vhdlrband WilliamShatner	https://twitter.com/vhdlrband/status/1020319091528122369
