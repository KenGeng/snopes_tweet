He's credited as the sole writer of Garfield Gets Real: pic.twitter.com/abcesC8fw2				1009813820037107714	1009806682967429120	akpruitt	https://twitter.com/LetItMelo/status/1009813820037107714	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgOUCSAV4AcE9PN.jpg

He's kind of an Anti Hello Kitty. Davis also seems to be "over" comics. He's credited as the sole writer of Garfield Gets Real: pic.twitter.com/abcesC8fw2				1009813820037107714	1009806682967429120	akpruitt	https://twitter.com/LetItMelo/status/1009813820037107714	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgOUCSAV4AcE9PN.jpg
