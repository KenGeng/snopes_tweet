Seems Centrists/Blairites are the same ideological ilk.

simpson_liz	2018-07-17 09:43	3	4	I think she actually believes this crap. None of this is working for the poor and vulnerable. Zero hour contracts counted as employed but really isn’t.

Tories are unshackled even in EU. 120,000 poverty deaths, homelessness, UN condemned sanctions...EU ignore this despot gov.
