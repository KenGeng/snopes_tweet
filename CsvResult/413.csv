ideabloke	2018-02-28 11:32	0	2	That's a good example of branding done from inside-out. They build a culture which their employees wholly buy into (and why wouldn't they?) and that becomes their brand. More effective than just slapping on a logo and calling it a brand. # brandchat			# brandchat	968886647054987265	968884293635395586	martinlieberman brandchat SouthwestAir	https://twitter.com/ideabloke/status/968886647054987265
