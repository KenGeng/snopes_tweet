SACarlyle2	2018-07-21 14:35	0	1	Mr. Trump sits on a gold toilet at Trump Tower; pays off his philandering affairs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet military personnel who defend our nation and democracy are forced to use food stamps to feed their families. What does Mr. Trump know or care about such things?				1020739017879572481			https://twitter.com/SACarlyle2/status/1020739017879572481
