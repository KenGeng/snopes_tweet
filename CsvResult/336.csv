Sadly, they're now taking their hatred of the President to a dangerous level. ABC, producer of the View is irresponsible for allowing the hate-filled spectacle to continue.

It seems instead of that we are taking away things like SNAP and public programs that can help people.				1021097898388451330	1020329851759284224	mojavethorn cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/Hjdshopgirl/status/1021097898388451330

Did see Ana Navarro's tweet who was sitting right beside Pirro and backs up Whoopi 100%.				1021097107091050496	1020329851759284224	globegirl09 RNRKentucky	https://twitter.com/KathySchwab77/status/1021097107091050496

I bet they won't buy her book because most of them can't read!				1021093966375260168	1020329851759284224	KathySchwab77 globegirl09	https://twitter.com/SteveScarborou4/status/1021093966375260168
