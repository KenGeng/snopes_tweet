Surfpapi	2018-07-02 21:41	0	1	Military service is definitely a family affair. A Soldier is only as strong as the spouse, the child, the Mother and Father or other loved one, who stands with and behind him/her. At times the home front can be as challenging as the Tip of the Spear.				1013960942726668288	1013957481515581441	mosbacher_mica	https://twitter.com/Surfpapi/status/1013960942726668288

His Father, a retired Capt said it was never about money.
