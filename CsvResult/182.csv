IjustHadToDoIt	2018-07-19 22:17	0	4	You ever play ping-pong, Joey? You remind me of the ball. Remember the video game breakout, you remind me of the ball there too. Darn, too many ball references. My bad, don't want to get you started on that, do we?				1020130531114090496	1020122981681508352	JoeyTM3	https://twitter.com/IjustHadToDoIt/status/1020130531114090496

TampireSucks	2018-07-18 16:34	0	9	I won a free Ping Pong session even though I rarely play that game and I thought my prize had to do with Super Smash Bros at first. Oh well, those balls better have eyeball designs when I decide to play lmao.				1019681802573828098	1019681247042392064		https://twitter.com/TampireSucks/status/1019681802573828098	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1003102255870930945/MHQWPcjB_normal.jpg

Up the difficulty please. Every player after Ping Pong King feels the same. Need longer rallies and less time to react to the ball. pic.twitter.com/eZTMgECOFl		@ OrangenoseTweet		1019665967641636865			https://twitter.com/jesse_hallock/status/1019665967641636865	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiaUyY_V4AAxflH.jpg
