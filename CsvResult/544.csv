I bourght a Christmas tree from a pop-up place down my road when I first moved in, they carried it to my flat, it was 5 minute conversation and I only told him my first name. 8 months later he messaged me on Facebook, https://twitter.com/elenacresci/status/1019898422575468544 …				1020025952838062080			https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1020025952838062080	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/979752566660698117/RfHWVElp_normal.jpg
