mythosXMakina	2018-06-11 23:19	0	1	justin trudeau is truly a faggot parading as 'normal married man' & 'prime-minister of canada', but the fake-eyebrow melting off his face in the middle of a press-briefing was truly the icing on his mcarthur's park career thus far! hilarious clown show! pic.twitter.com/v0FMm260HN				1006375478490365953			https://twitter.com/mythosXMakina/status/1006375478490365953	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfddJ8JV4AMCXEk.jpg

SkepticalHusky	2018-06-11 05:05	0	1	The obvious questions here are: “why would a man ever wear false eyebrows? In public? When you are Prime Minister of Canada? When you are being interviewed? At the G7”? To which the answer is Justin Trudeau. Now it makes sense.				1006100128388845568	1006082353507262464	dearaunty	https://twitter.com/SkepticalHusky/status/1006100128388845568

He wears fake eyebrows, which fell off at the # G7 summit. I don't even wear fake eyebrows, and I am female.		@ ARmastrangelo	# G7	1005991178095943680			https://twitter.com/kmhboiler/status/1005991178095943680
