And embarrasses canada with his pandering foreign dress that sjw's must condemn as cultural appropriation -				1006752622928449538			https://twitter.com/ServantOfEhyeh/status/1006752622928449538

Smiling in their face & bad-mouthing them behind their back?Let 'em find other buyers for their felt-tip pens & Chinese steel. If tariffs are ok for Canada, then they're ok for us. Trudeau is a sissy drama queen with fake eyebrows.				1006679947849674752	1006665224995393536	HappyLiberal1 seijeff	https://twitter.com/duucellier_toby/status/1006679947849674752
