SaronBench	2018-07-07 12:11	2	4	I thought that issue was settled with Elian Gonzalez. Cuba. You cannot keep a child from their parent who lives in another country. That was thoroughly reviewed, and, the laws of the United States of America must be followed, according 2 Attorney General Janet Reno. Look it up.				1015629366125121536	1015553741028839424	EdKrassen	https://twitter.com/SaronBench/status/1015629366125121536

When you tear up a copy of the Constitution in protest, you are demonstrating that you want the United States of America to cease to exist. If Janet Reno was still the AG, you would be back in Cuba in a heartbeat https://twitter.com/jojoh888/status/978069969379446784 â€¦				978290277193519106			https://twitter.com/GradyArt/status/978290277193519106	https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/978069945228713984/pu/img/nw0EMpbbZ6EgRKlH.jpg

The Marxist Democrats cheered wildly.				963251438125289473			https://twitter.com/MayforTexas/status/963251438125289473
