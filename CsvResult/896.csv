Iran has actively fought ISIS almost everywhere in Syria and Iraq.				941038475238928384	941033322087632897		https://twitter.com/alorientalist/status/941038475238928384	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/995257709179088896/StLSGYsp_normal.jpg

Look at what happened yo them in Iraq after Hussein was toppled.				933559334168092672	933492262889144320	McFaul	https://twitter.com/_StevenHunter_/status/933559334168092672	
RandallFrench14	2017-11-20 16:33	0	2	Syria isn't a good candidate to attack Iran since Iran is allied with Syria in the Syrian civil war. Iraq is a Shia majority country in which the Syrian government is allied with at least some Shia. Lebanon is a complex society with powerful forces allied for and against Iran.				932723609075773440	932717931552653312		https://twitter.com/RandallFrench14/status/932723609075773440	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/830239118500040705/LkmPGiAf_normal.jpg
