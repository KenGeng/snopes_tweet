Or is it you really don't know what you're doing?				1018938402983628800	1018890862653157381	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/StefanGutenberg/status/1018938402983628800

He’s the f’n president of the United States of America - not the leader of the elementary school playground. # treasonsummit2018			# treasonsummit2018	1018934674872258561	1018928811109478407	deputydog186 IngrahamAngle	https://twitter.com/SandyCheeks7508/status/1018934674872258561
