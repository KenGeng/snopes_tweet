They believe most people born into this world will reject Christ and up in hell forever. What is so bad about abortion?				1014719674125148161	1014690405143719938	BenjamNMulroney zelda85044	https://twitter.com/BenjamNMulroney/status/1014719674125148161

You know you’re sexist for saying this right. A women should have the right to her body. Period.				1014565403903778816	1013182151188045824	WibowoKobe	https://twitter.com/NeverlynnP/status/1014565403903778816

After conception, a "baby" is called an EMBRYO! , till the first heartbeats are detectable, (about 3 to 4 months), after that a FETUS till it's born (outside the womb!). BTW, nowhere in the Bible do you find abortion mentioned.				1014562058543738885	1014250622785327104	DB7230 knicnaq	https://twitter.com/AJuttaHBrink1/status/1014562058543738885

The law was quite clear what should happen if a fetus was even accidentally killed. Abortion is the murder of a human https://twitter.com/LifeNewsHQ/status/1014222501189181441 …			# Christians	1014553376498114561			https://twitter.com/OolongCaluphid/status/1014553376498114561	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhM9_UOXkAAP4lJ.jpg
