Just_A_Pilgrim_	2018-07-16 05:32	0	1	I would be interested to know what action the police take against LGBT activists when they graffiti churches, threaten violent attacks including rape and arson. The hate that Asher's bakery has faced, hate videos against the Salvation army, all because they won't say gay is ok.				1018790455616602112	1018419925591961600	theweeflea ancresbyjacq	https://twitter.com/Just_A_Pilgrim_/status/1018790455616602112	
TheCheesyChin	2018-07-08 22:37	0	0	The Salvation Army is tax payer funded. It is religiously based (hello 1st amendment), and has an abhorrent track record of discrimination against the LGBT community. Its CEO has been quoted as saying he’d refuse service to an injured, dying gay person.				1016149194241986560	1016135548312797185	justiceorkarma	https://twitter.com/TheCheesyChin/status/1016149194241986560
