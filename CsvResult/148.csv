Eichman, "desecration" of the flag is a form of expression protected under the First Amendment.				1020310383708508166	1020110571058941953	Me_VidaLoca ranaenelly	https://twitter.com/PaladinZilch/status/1020310383708508166

No more donations to KU from me, ever. There should be no tax dollars as well. # ksleghttps://twitter.com/KUnews/status/1017169864073662466 …			# ksleghttps	1017499581016432640			https://twitter.com/PrairieShay/status/1017499581016432640

i_sing_my_heart	2018-07-11 23:04	0	0	Penalties are written into the United States Flag Code, this is U.S. federal law...unfortunately, it is not enforced. Not knowing, many folks now consider flag desecration as an expression of freedom of speech. I do not. I believe it should always be enforced. https://twitter.com/LionTedPride/status/1017241761549307904 …				1017243248203530247			https://twitter.com/i_sing_my_heart/status/1017243248203530247

PrairieShay	2018-07-11 16:13	0	2	Obviously some do not understand the "do not desecrate" of our flag. One would think as much money as KU receives, they would be turning out well educated students. 18 U.S. Code § 700 - Desecration of the flag of the United States.				1017139730855747591	1017131630744530944	GovJeffColyer	https://twitter.com/PrairieShay/status/1017139730855747591
