That meme about vanilla ice cream originally being black in color but was changed to white to appease white people is # fakenews!			# fakenews	1004145279455645697			https://twitter.com/empiresesquire/status/1004145279455645697	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1012804801057263617/wbqdE-3X_normal.jpg

Kikiii_kb	2018-05-28 23:29	0	0	Like the shit pisses me off. I’m the lightest of my friends. Skin the same color of vanilla ice cream. Have I used my skin color to justify the way I act. No I’m not bougie. No I don’t think I’m better than anyone. No I don’t believe every black male is attracted girls my color.				1001304456624050176			https://twitter.com/Kikiii_kb/status/1001304456624050176

EbonyApplePy	2018-04-22 21:20	0	0	You can't ignore that he's a black man. I understand your point but disregarding his color yet complimenting his character is a backhand compliment. Accept all of him. That's like picking out the chocolate chips and eating only the vanilla ice cream.				988225969591934976	988153165425070080	IdahoIndependen ABC	https://twitter.com/EbonyApplePy/status/988225969591934976

Zoehannn	2018-03-07 09:48	0	0	Cause vanilla ice cream used to be black and white people couldnt believe that something that was black tasted so good so they changed the color and I believed that pushed them into that type of ice cream https://twitter.com/finegodmother/status/971155525231632385 …				971397264039084032			https://twitter.com/Zoehannn/status/971397264039084032	
WavyBoomin	2018-03-01 12:07	4	5	it’s a color thing. only black/mixed ones are valid. not the spicy vanilla ice cream ones. https://twitter.com/auntieog_/status/969219491715481600 …				969257709152407553			https://twitter.com/WavyBoomin/status/969257709152407553	
ForgetAmnesia	2018-02-21 21:28	0	5	her logic was that because she only used the color cartridge and didn't need the black cartridge, she could return it. But they're part of a set, lol "ma'am, that would be like trying to return ice cream because you ate the strawberry and chocolate but didn't touch vanilla"				966499950858293248	966499752425803776		https://twitter.com/ForgetAmnesia/status/966499950858293248	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/980571127478210563/VVY_oIRX_normal.jpg
