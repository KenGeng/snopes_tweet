tomreedwriting	2018-07-06 03:53	0	0	Nick, a gambling levy a la horse racing needs to be investigated. This was proposed in France as a sports betting right for bookmakers to adhere to in order to access the markets. Seems healthier than blanket advertising and sponsorship?				1015141609955102720	1014770150812409856	sportingintel mark_thegooner thecentristboy	https://twitter.com/tomreedwriting/status/1015141609955102720

As a user of your gyms and someone currently doing the # GOplasticfree July with @ mcsuk, was wondering if you'd consider advertising the use of reusable bottles instead of single use ones in your gyms around the UK?

Louisepru	2018-07-23 14:11	0	0	This poor horse!! Yes, a 4 year old horse doesn't just die like that unless grossly overworked. The horse racing industry is known to use drugs and force to make the hoses run faster - to become a win for their owners.
