SeibaaHomu	2018-02-22 00:06	0	1	Haha good, because Ted Cruz once made a competition where you could ‘Netflix and chill’ with him but... well I don’t think he knew what it meant. It’s not REALLY romance but one movie I really like is Baby Driver. I think it has the same lead actor as The Fault in Our Stars				966539633541578753	966310144060502017	GuiltyNightEmi	https://twitter.com/SeibaaHomu/status/966539633541578753

And how are ISPs gonna pay for that and still remain profitable enough to stay open (so you can have your Netflix & chill)? You didn't think about that.				943074810174812160	941489723901665280	edcarmonajr tedcruz	https://twitter.com/SleeveMeAlone/status/943074810174812160
