The United States needs to stand up to other countries that have been using us as a whipping board for several decades as far as trade goes.				1004873931856273410	1004139692504354816	Bubbie071 derf_smith	https://twitter.com/Bubbie071/status/1004873931856273410

Outlaws52	2018-05-09 08:08	1	1	Cool story. The United States may not but Iranian oil but it still buys a ton of oil. Global demand is a factor in oil prices. If the US put sanctions on Iranian oil making it unavailable to the global market the global supply shrinks. Therefore the price goes up.				994187346059771910	993976643898281984	bill1usmc PalmerReport	https://twitter.com/Outlaws52/status/994187346059771910

Is that your vision for American government? Yes or no.				993589518640009221	993483042177118208	RobStarkey79 Dena3332	https://twitter.com/PeterMDavies80/status/993589518640009221

A prospective user must go through an application process administered by the ATF.
