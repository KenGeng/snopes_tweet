Laurie_Garrett	2018-05-30 13:22	8	11	One of the top 5 reasons girls stay home from school & suffer inadequate education is menstruation -- they haven't sanitary products, and schools lack private girl's bathrooms & hand-washing facilities.

During the course of the evening someone unknown had crudely written on the signs in feltpen to "designate" them. Neither bathroom had urinals, they were just bathrooms - individual stalls with hand washing.				1001814030967885825	1001698969683193858	0xbron bronwyn	https://twitter.com/mike_hooz/status/1001814030967885825
