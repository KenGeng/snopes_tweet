MarcusRaven86	2018-07-08 20:11	0	1	If we can't find anybody better than @ RealHughJackman for Wolverine, can we go ahead and press forward where X-23 takes on the mantle?

Iam_RocketShark	2018-06-27 11:18	0	3	If they recast Logan, I will literally riot. If they bring the X-Men into the MCU, the only possible way I will accept it is if they cast an actress as an older X-23, follow the continuity of Logan, and have HER be Wolverine instead. No one else can play Logam but Hugh Jackman. https://twitter.com/Leg10nOfBoom/status/1011296057328898048 …				1011992280016748544			https://twitter.com/Iam_RocketShark/status/1011992280016748544	
BruinsNHL30	2018-06-10 09:36	0	0	Hey @ robertliefeld @ VancityReynolds needs to figure out how to use that time sliding device to go to the future and grab @ DafneKeen x-23 out of the future for x-force! If we can’t have @ RealHughJackman then we should go for the far superior wolverine. She outclassed him in Logan!		@ robertliefeld @ VancityReynolds @ DafneKeen @ RealHughJackman		1005805936924069894			https://twitter.com/BruinsNHL30/status/1005805936924069894	
SpiderCanary99	2018-06-09 17:05	1	10	Logan is a fantastic movie I'm sorry for pissing everyone I'm rewatching I still loved Hugh Jackman every film he's in and I loved X-23 though. Yes I seen all the X-Men movies including all the Wolverine standalone movies. Plus I do watch X-Men cartoons and I am a X-Men fan.				1005556503862968320			https://twitter.com/SpiderCanary99/status/1005556503862968320	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1017997018705399808/uqo8fZIZ_normal.jpg
SalMarra927	2018-03-03 11:54	1	10	Today marks a year since the release of # LOGAN. If you haven’t seen it already, check it out. @ RealHughJackman gives a FANTASTIC final performance as Wolverine, @ SirPatStew gives a heartbreaking performance as Professor X and @ DafneKeen is a complete badass as X-23!! pic.twitter.com/iv3VfZo5RE		@ RealHughJackman @ SirPatStew @ DafneKeen	# LOGAN	969979345551884288			https://twitter.com/SalMarra927/status/969979345551884288	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXYPEToVwAAnch4.jpg
J_Rhone18	2018-02-01 09:34	0	6	Am I the only one who would be really irritated if Disney reboots the Wolverine films? Like a new actor that is not hugh jackman idk that would probably piss me off if they want to intergrate wolverine into the mcu use Laura aka X-23 or even use dakken don’t use Logan				959072542471307264			https://twitter.com/J_Rhone18/status/959072542471307264	
t_shults89	2018-01-19 12:37	0	0	Here's how @ Disney & @ MarvelStudios should handle Wolverine in the MCU: Tony Stark & pals (let's call them The @ Avengers) find an OLD MAN named LOGAN (let's say the actor is @ RealHughJackman). He tells them he's retired, but introduces Laura (X-23) to the MCU as Wolverine!

ThealphaP	2018-01-13 19:02	0	17	Re watched Logan again bloody hell Dafne keen is an amazing actor there needs to be a laura/x-23 movie! Still sad to see @ RealHughJackman retire from the Logan role you will always be the Wolverine you was made for him.

SilverWarg	2018-01-04 09:04	0	1	No one yet it's to soon and they would immediately be comoared to @ RealHughJackman and no one is winning against him. I actually really like the portrayal of x-23 in logan movie maybe have the female wolverine in until they can figure out how to get Hugh back		@ RealHughJackman		948918169732775937	948916929057533952	ComicBook	https://twitter.com/SilverWarg/status/948918169732775937	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f601.png

JimKWeaver	2017-12-29 22:22	0	0	Wolverine is far and away the most popular X-Man, and easily top 3 among all Marvel heroes. Ignoring that just seems like a foolish move by Disney. And despite what Marvel has tried to push with Laura (an interesting character in her own right), Logan IS Wolverine. Laura is X-23.				946944532750454785	946837197059252224	CyberCyclone360 JSandlinWriter	https://twitter.com/JimKWeaver/status/946944532750454785	
ZarithZainullah	2017-12-29 08:44	0	0	No 3 - Logan Live action for the awesome game The Last of Us,minus the clickers. Hugh Jackman with his final hurrah as the Wolverine. Perfect ending for the Legend. I really want to see more of Laura/X-23 in the near future.

BrownDethstroke	2017-12-20 13:01	1	4	6. Logan I LOVED Logan but no, it's not the next dark knight (in my opinion) What it is though is a brilliant & heart touching send off to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine & the fox X-Men era. Everything about this movie is pure art!

RowellBradley	2017-12-20 12:16	0	3	( SPOILER ALERT!)I watched it on DVD and it turns out after pausing it at the right moment, I found out I have the same blood type as Wolverine Logan's Daughter. Loved the movie to bits and the girl who played Wolverines daughter I think was X -23 was excellent and it is cool				943530631669182464	943444840343273472	WolverSteve WolverineMovie	https://twitter.com/RowellBradley/status/943530631669182464	
NerfedTV	2017-12-15 03:29	0	0	With the # DisneyFoxDeal happening, and @ RealHughJackman not wanting to return to Wolverine, I really hope they fully embrace Laura Kinney.

Jrnotjnr	2017-12-14 20:18	9	27	Fox did a great job casting Hugh Jackman as Logan. Marvel finding the right suitor is almost impossible. Unless they make X-23 their new Wolverine.
