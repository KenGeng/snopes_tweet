I guess they got tired of seeing white people acting a fool on social media and got excited.				1017149160838041601	1017099996804632577	KDVR	https://twitter.com/J_E_B_88/status/1017149160838041601	
Left_Side_Drive	2018-07-01 09:20	0	1	I see a lot of white people, especially on social media, ordering black people to “stop making everything about race.” It’s disappointing how blind these people are that blacks are often defensive about race because they’re so regularly discriminated against w/ racism & bigotry.				1013412026591449088	1013198867159048194	usnehal MoniaWerlang	https://twitter.com/Left_Side_Drive/status/1013412026591449088

SJMClol	2018-01-09 14:15	0	1	I'll be honest- before it started happening on pol, I didn't give a shit about race whatsoever. I dug beneath the surface, and found nothing but racism towards whites on social media (completely acceptable of course), and "BLACK PRIDE FUCK WHITE PEOPLE." 1/2				950808321740681217	950505771133034496	tomusvult AdamWilliams436	https://twitter.com/SJMClol/status/950808321740681217	
malshimama	2016-09-23 08:39	7	20	Sick of seeing black people slating white people on social media. You can't preach about racism while discriminating against another race.				779299250022838273			https://twitter.com/malshimama/status/779299250022838273
