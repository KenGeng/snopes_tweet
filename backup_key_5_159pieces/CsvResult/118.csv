I think if I were a teacher (and my wife is) I would like the CHOICE to carry a firearm to protect myself and my students. Israel trains their teachers, and all school shootings have ceased. Donâ€™t let facts get in the way.				966534785500876802	966512605807378433	ryanstruyk	https://twitter.com/budfoxnole/status/966534785500876802

Then the adults could have protected the students. But nooooo...

We can learn a lot from Israel, they arm their teachers, no school shootings there. # guncontrol # shooting			# guncontrol # shooting	963900127743217664			https://twitter.com/thebencade/status/963900127743217664
