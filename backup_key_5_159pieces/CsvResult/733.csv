walsh48KF	2018-05-15 07:04	7	20	Not in my wages! In fact I am worse off. Obviously I understand your pay meets your demanding role, whilst I as a simple police Officer should be grateful for what I get. A 2 hour commute as I’m priced out of London, a 10 year old car, monthly wage worse than 10 years ago.

coralivesey	2018-04-06 15:28	0	0	Why was height requirement dropped for police officers for both men and women? A 5’3” male police officer wearing glasses really not going to cut it on a London street. Ditto tiny women police officers, of whom Cressida Dick is one.

I'm sure anyone mugged in the meantime will be delighted.				981642337498648577			https://twitter.com/ChristineH_2017/status/981642337498648577
