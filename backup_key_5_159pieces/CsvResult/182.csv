Sturdygirl0803	2018-07-21 12:14	0	3	Then there was a game where there was a small box with ping pong balls in, it was tied round the waist & they had to twerk to get the balls out of the box.				1020703503688392704			https://twitter.com/Sturdygirl0803/status/1020703503688392704

3JazzCats	2018-07-21 00:12	1	4	Mum quit letting us play on the iPad. It had gotten to the point where she couldn’t turn it in without one of us wanting to play a game. We would paw at it till she gave in. Finally, she cut us off and got us a huge supply of ping pong balls.				1020521929265074176	1020467064379588608	TheCrazySaguaro StrayLiotta NHVNaturalPet	https://twitter.com/3JazzCats/status/1020521929265074176	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f639.png

DozTweets	2018-07-20 18:22	0	3	LOL! Do crisis merchants understand how hard it would be to just stop being an NRL fan and go follow another code? You really think Barry from Western Sydney is gonna go follow the “airial ping pong”, “round ball game” or “rahrah”...nah..me either. https://twitter.com/marklevy2gb/status/1020254835407347712 …				1020433669993914369			https://twitter.com/DozTweets/status/1020433669993914369	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1019518055196475392/orueT3Rv_normal.jpg

IjustHadToDoIt	2018-07-19 22:17	0	4	You ever play ping-pong, Joey? You remind me of the ball. Remember the video game breakout, you remind me of the ball there too. Darn, too many ball references.

TampireSucks	2018-07-18 16:34	0	9	I won a free Ping Pong session even though I rarely play that game and I thought my prize had to do with Super Smash Bros at first. Oh well, those balls better have eyeball designs when I decide to play lmao.				1019681802573828098	1019681247042392064		https://twitter.com/TampireSucks/status/1019681802573828098	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1003102255870930945/MHQWPcjB_normal.jpg
jesse_hallock	2018-07-18 15:31	0	0	@ OrangenoseTweet Jeff Chen was right on when he said “I made this game too easy.” I didn’t lose one match.... beat the game in 15 minutes. Up the difficulty please. Every player after Ping Pong King feels the same. Need longer rallies and less time to react to the ball. pic.twitter.com/eZTMgECOFl		@ OrangenoseTweet		1019665967641636865			https://twitter.com/jesse_hallock/status/1019665967641636865	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiaUyY_V4AAxflH.jpg

TheMiddle123	2018-07-17 11:32	0	0	The ping pong ball just wants to survive the game. Blaming it for the player's swings is not quite fair.				1019243376971952128	1019241968973570049	ChemiShalev	https://twitter.com/TheMiddle123/status/1019243376971952128	
SMaxwell98	2018-07-17 09:53	0	1	I remember seeing stuff about how the planets are in retrograde so you may have weird dreams or whatever and I thought it was all hogwash. But last night I had a dream I was delivering a baby while playing a game of soccer with a ping pong ball.
