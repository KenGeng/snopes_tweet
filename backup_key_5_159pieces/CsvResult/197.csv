Outlaws52	2018-05-09 08:08	1	1	Cool story. The United States may not but Iranian oil but it still buys a ton of oil. Global demand is a factor in oil prices. If the US put sanctions on Iranian oil making it unavailable to the global market the global supply shrinks. Therefore the price goes up.				994187346059771910	993976643898281984	bill1usmc PalmerReport	https://twitter.com/Outlaws52/status/994187346059771910
