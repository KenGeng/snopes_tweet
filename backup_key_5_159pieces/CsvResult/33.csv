DankDerpJr	2018-06-04 10:24	5	14	After this b******* false racism charge I no longer shop at Starbucks and instead and I'm now visiting local coffee houses. We do not need separate sets of rules for people of color versus white people.				1003643580555153408	1001405260995346433	Starbucks	https://twitter.com/DankDerpJr/status/1003643580555153408

IamTheMacrocosm	2018-04-19 12:13	1	4	The number of white people angry because they won’t have Starbucks for one day is unsurprisingly amazing. They’re upset about not having coffee for one day, but can’t understand systematic racism that routinely denies marginalized people things far greater than damn coffee .				987001272011296769			https://twitter.com/IamTheMacrocosm/status/987001272011296769	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f914.png
