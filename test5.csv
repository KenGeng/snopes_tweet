The 11 year old in me wishes you a fun day reliving memories of the '93 team!				1018158769086312449	1018157860927234048	ChrisTannehill whitesox Shep670	https://twitter.com/ChrisLowy/status/1018158769086312449

mechurchlady	2018-07-13 03:35	0	0	Joan is right and read about autistic famous Temple Grandin. She found the crusher calmed her. The device is only used to work on the horse or cow. Try trimming a bad hood or so minor care. Also crushing a cow destroys the best part of the cow! Sorry had to say that.				1017673875570774017	1017506637119180801	joannie67 herbivore_club boucherhayes	https://twitter.com/mechurchlady/status/1017673875570774017
