Eichman, "desecration" of the flag is a form of expression protected under the First Amendment.				1020310383708508166	1020110571058941953	Me_VidaLoca ranaenelly	https://twitter.com/PaladinZilch/status/1020310383708508166

PrairieShay	2018-07-12 16:02	0	0	It seems they still plan to have the flag on display--just not on the pole. It is desecration of the United States flag, no matter where you place it. No more donations to KU from me, ever. There should be no tax dollars as well. # ksleghttps://twitter.com/KUnews/status/1017169864073662466 …			# ksleghttps	1017499581016432640			https://twitter.com/PrairieShay/status/1017499581016432640

i_sing_my_heart	2018-07-11 23:04	0	0	Penalties are written into the United States Flag Code, this is U.S. federal law...unfortunately, it is not enforced. Not knowing, many folks now consider flag desecration as an expression of freedom of speech. I do not. I believe it should always be enforced. https://twitter.com/LionTedPride/status/1017241761549307904 …				1017243248203530247			https://twitter.com/i_sing_my_heart/status/1017243248203530247
