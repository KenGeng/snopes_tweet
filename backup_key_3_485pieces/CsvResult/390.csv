anthrosaurian	2018-07-14 10:33	0	0	Oh! In Germany. Hmm, I could have sworn we were talking about Anti-fascism in the United States. Funny how the only examples you people can find of "violent antifa" groups are always in other countries. Its like you're trying to mislead people or something. ;)				1018141436716437504			https://twitter.com/anthrosaurian/status/1018141436716437504

Liberals want to change it & make us more like a communist country with political prisoners for "hate speech" which is disagreement.				1013417000251609094	1013243746237014017	peregrinepadre JackPosobiec HillelSims	https://twitter.com/cshaw0048/status/1013417000251609094
