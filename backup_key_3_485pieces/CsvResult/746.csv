Meiguo_nan	2018-07-18 13:41	0	2	At first I though Norman Rockwell, beloved American author, painter & illustrator would be upset with the defiling of his painting. However, it's much more likely he would be disgusted & repulsed by # Trump, # Putin & # GOP # Republicans defiling the American culture he championed.pic.twitter.com/1np1uRxSIl			# Trump # Putin # GOP # Republicans	1019638299328176128	1019624126917509121	HunkyGayJesus	https://twitter.com/Meiguo_nan/status/1019638299328176128	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiZ7i0PVAAAWBcJ.jpg

4FreedomsPark	2018-07-17 14:58	1	0	Today we visited @ NYHistory to witness the 4 Freedoms through Norman Rockwell's paintings. The freedom of religion with the ability to worship god in their own way while co-existing with one another is shown. It sends a message to accept cultural diversity. # 4freedomsinterns2018pic.twitter.com/2CY2qvosAK – bei New York Historical Society Museum & Library		@ NYHistory	# 4freedomsinterns2018pic	1019295222637973504			https://twitter.com/4FreedomsPark/status/1019295222637973504	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiVDmB_WsAI9CjF.jpg
