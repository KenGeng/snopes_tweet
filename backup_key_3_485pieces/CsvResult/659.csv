SACarlyle2	2018-07-21 14:35	0	1	Mr. Trump sits on a gold toilet at Trump Tower; pays off his philandering affairs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet military personnel who defend our nation and democracy are forced to use food stamps to feed their families. What does Mr. Trump know or care about such things?				1020739017879572481			https://twitter.com/SACarlyle2/status/1020739017879572481	
JEG_Booth96	2018-07-20 22:42	0	0	As a matter of personal taste, I detest anything golden; the Trump Tower toilets, the 1980s doorknobs, watches, neck chains, everything I once made a lot of money on gold based on a relative’s advice (a recovering goldbug, happens in the best families) I felt guilty and dirty :(				1020499308251164672	1020497045684137991	JEG_Booth96 TBPInvictus mark_dow	https://twitter.com/JEG_Booth96/status/1020499308251164672
