Reform_Required	2018-07-04 05:51	0	3	He makes some good points, but you can not "call out" white people for the historic slave trade 1, slavery was practised in the Muslim world before the trans-Atlantic slave trade 2, It's still being done in areas under Muslim rule today, such as Libya (nice job NATO).				1014446625358598144	1014442442634887168	Independent	https://twitter.com/Reform_Required/status/1014446625358598144

andrejakuz	2018-06-20 16:35	0	1	concentration camps are not relegated only to the jewish holocaust. when we see slavery in libya, we dont call it something else because of the horrific history of the atlantic slave trade. dont focus on semantics when atrocities are happening https://twitter.com/IjeomaOluo/status/1008844937561948162 …				1009535328191897600			https://twitter.com/andrejakuz/status/1009535328191897600

peekaymila	2018-05-01 19:56	0	1	You wanna know if I think slaves of the Atlantic slave trade era willingly jumped into ships to be sold? I think not. It's illogical that they would. At least I speak for the majority. However, today, we have people paying their way into slavery in Libya.				991466493643771905	991452817624829952	peekaymila olaoluwapaul akintonmide	https://twitter.com/peekaymila/status/991466493643771905

If that wasn't enough Nigerians are luring other Nigerians to Libya and when they can't pay they sell them into slavery right now !				986417193528283137	984897619641229317	_Giift EllAyeZeeWhy	https://twitter.com/paxasisprime/status/986417193528283137	
fairygabbmother	2018-02-14 18:21	0	1	It was always disheartening to hear of physical slavery throughout history like the trans Atlantic slave trade and even the horrors of the Holocaust but wtf there's actual hard up slavery in Libya right now we need to do something!!!				963916197258555392			https://twitter.com/fairygabbmother/status/963916197258555392	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1020060511457751041/SXLhqRSK_normal.jpg

Afrowomanist	2017-11-30 14:25	0	2	How we gone believe white folk telling us about slavery in Libya while they're not remorseful about the Atlantic Slave trade. They need to take several seats.

ALI_RIDHA_KHAN	2017-11-29 13:22	10	20	I find it interesting that we're raging about slavery in Libya but we neglect human trafficking as it excedes the amount of slaves taken in the trans-atlantic slave trade. Don't let your activism be guided by what's trending. Slavery is an everyday occurrence, stay woke.				935937137928753153			https://twitter.com/ALI_RIDHA_KHAN/status/935937137928753153	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1004412774041124865/jOoL3nVd_normal.jpg

He was fired after speaking on the Present slave trade in addition to the past slavery (which they hired him for). UN didn’t give a fuck about Libya then and they don’t now				935867193987825666			https://twitter.com/dez1thing/status/935867193987825666	
Qarboo	2017-11-28 18:45	2	2	As a young school boy, reading about the TRANS-ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE often came to me as fiction. But today in 2017, Libya have decided to show me a practical example that slavery exists. It's a pity!

mojomha	2017-11-19 16:24	0	0	Your terminology isn't accurate. No slavery in Islam. To my knowledge there is no slaves being bought or sold in Libya. If you have proof of such I would love to see it. As for the largest slavery trade ever check Trans Atlantic slave trade on google				932358943195533312	931940774232674305	freeanatolia CraigCons	https://twitter.com/mojomha/status/932358943195533312	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f915.png
