lindkanne	2018-06-06 11:01	0	0	The fuchsia has Biblical connections. There is an ancient story the fuchsia sprang from the Blood of Christ at the foot of the cross. Its pendants dangle because it hangs “its head from sorrow” and the flower represents the Virgin Mary’s earrings. @ Kadir https://teespring.com/fuchsia-flower-tee-8766?page=2&tsmac=store&tsmic=bear-blessings#pid=370&cid=6534&sid=front …pic.twitter.com/zmclTd0UNQ		@ Kadir		1004377857538179072			https://twitter.com/lindkanne/status/1004377857538179072	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfBEU0dUYAEtmhZ.jpg

Which is similar to the crucifixion of Jesus Also, Adonis' birth and death is similar to Jesus Christ, Born of a Virgin & when he died, Venus(his lover, kinda) made his blood turn into a flower..				997114000256233472	997112754346618882		https://twitter.com/eDante_/status/997114000256233472	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1011854303936565248/CJ3y-tYr_normal.jpg

SolerenitySpa	2018-02-11 07:09	0	0	Benefits of Passion flower tea are reducing anxiety, depression, blood pressure, and inflammation.

It enlightens those who use it, to open the flower of the world,and damns those who glorify it, confounding riches with the soul.				946866800649744384			https://twitter.com/ma1rd/status/946866800649744384
