I don't know how big Brooklyn is, but I get the impression you couldn't throw a Starbucks there without hitting a writer. @ Starbucks - please send me free lamborghinis for advertising your fine product :)		@ Starbucks		1020726488918736896	1020724552429551617	mramberg Lamborghini	https://twitter.com/JellyfishReview/status/1020726488918736896

However, I do agree they are advertising to the more liberal crowd right now and I feel they either need to stay out of politics or keep in the middle				1020719362796335104	1009168980316057600	gifsgalore2 TrumpBrakes	https://twitter.com/gifsgalore2/status/1020719362796335104
