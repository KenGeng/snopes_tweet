RonnieFilyaw	2018-07-21 18:53	1	3	if i made a dragon ball game, i'd definitely struggle to think of any other characters, like raditz, dodoria, zarbon, caulifla, kale, cabba, 19, 20, cell jr, gogeta, kaioshin, kibito, jet pack mr satan, roshi, dabura, babidi, spopovich, or launch. or if we're talking OG DB...				1020803885273944064			https://twitter.com/RonnieFilyaw/status/1020803885273944064	
mrdodger1966	2018-07-21 18:52	0	0	@ OccupyDodgers I’m at this Brewers game tonight... I expect nothing less than Kersh 7 innings of 1-run ball and Machado HR. Watch... Kersh will be good vs Aguilar and Braun, but Kratz or Saladino will take him deep. The Paniks/Ahmeds usually get him.		@ OccupyDodgers		1020803716201500674	1020767272351281154	DodgerNationLAX	https://twitter.com/mrdodger1966/status/1020803716201500674	
ddparko	2018-07-21 18:52	0	0	Didnt see much panic when they were 2 up deep in injury time hit a short kick out and worked the ball upfield for another score. Wee Bradley done great but goals win games and Tyrone never looked like getting one.

dokodonmystery	2018-07-21 18:51	0	1	it seems like the english fire emblem writers usually have to rewrite a lot of the japanese script to make it an acceptably serious story rather than a dragon ball z season in video game form in fire emblem radiant dawn they completely rewrote the ending to fix a major plot hole				1020803478497775618	1020723319228657664	Bee_Kirby TheRealQNS	https://twitter.com/dokodonmystery/status/1020803478497775618

Hashtagkangas	2018-07-21 18:47	0	0	His old man used to get a lot of the ball but was very slow. Even back in those days he was slow.

TheCoachRonnie	2018-07-21 18:46	0	1	Can you explain why you think 36 players in half a ground and 20 players around the ball is good for footy? It's all about the coaches keeping the scores low so you are always in the game with a chance to win.				1020802108071686145	1020645139851575297	GregDavis_cmail	https://twitter.com/TheCoachRonnie/status/1020802108071686145

ImSuperDope_	2018-07-21 18:43	0	2	Got to ball for 3 hours today & I was hooping a bit. At the last game, after I was so exhausted I was like let me record this & make a bootleg mixtape I can send to @ nba so they can draft me as an official baller.

EAPerform	2018-07-21 18:43	0	0	Kid throws a ball as hard as he can on a run from CF to smoke a runner at home,no one bats an eye. Kid throws a “run and gun” to a radar gun...it’s dangerous.
