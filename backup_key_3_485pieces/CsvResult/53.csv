In addition to Nike, Adidas, Budweiser, McDonald’s, and Coca-Cola, this collection includes ads from broadcasters, Icelandic vodka, gambling sites, e-commerce platforms, Spotify, and a beer in Argentina. Watch these commercials! # WorldCuphttps://twitter.com/FastCompany/status/1007752134639734784 …			# WorldCuphttps	1007761526034493440			https://twitter.com/PrriyaRaj/status/1007761526034493440

winterion	2017-11-08 13:34	0	3	Still mind-boggling that Barq's Root Beer, @ CocaCola's root beer since the 1995 acquisition, has no meaningful social media presence or traditional advertising and inexplicable/inconsistent distribution of its Red Creme and Creme sodas. @ CocaColaCo is worth $200 billion dollars.		@ CocaCola @ CocaColaCo		928329827156979712			https://twitter.com/winterion/status/928329827156979712	
PaulDSki6556	2017-09-23 20:10	0	1	@ Budweiser should sue for false advertising on @ CocaCola. Beer and pizza is such a better combination. This is an American pillar of truth.		@ Budweiser @ CocaCola		911744682203508736			https://twitter.com/PaulDSki6556/status/911744682203508736
