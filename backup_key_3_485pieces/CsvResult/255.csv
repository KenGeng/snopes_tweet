Peckhampulse	2018-07-21 17:46	0	0	Maybe Gypsy Roma should link up with main stream anti racist anti fascist groups like Stand Up to Racism, Unite against Fascism and Antifa, Anti Fascist Network then we could all work together				1020787114928205824	1020716793210507264	BenBennett26	https://twitter.com/Peckhampulse/status/1020787114928205824	
MarenHofstad	2018-07-17 08:59	0	4	This winners timeline is all over the wack-o-sphere. Mostly hate. Some racism and sexism for good measure. Can’t really define why Anti-fascism is a bad thing. We fought a world war as Antifa. We won.				1019204946737197056	1019037438654599169	2020_kaga DineshDSouza	https://twitter.com/MarenHofstad/status/1019204946737197056

Kids in internment camps won’t be the end of it. Congress is passing an Anti-Antifa bill. Soon, we’re all going to jail for calling out racism and fascism. https://twitter.com/rolandscahill/status/1016843872624734208 …				1017195933845426177			https://twitter.com/ChiChiMontreal/status/1017195933845426177

EpilepticHorse	2018-07-07 16:45	0	0	Antifa isn't an actual group. Unless you mean people who are anti racism as the name suggests? Everyone should be, why, are you for fascism? You must have more in common with Nazis than Nazi haters if you're this invested in defending then. Nazi apologists go home.				1015698331459174400	1015560742152626177	Hellawulf kyuofcosmic BoozyBadger	https://twitter.com/EpilepticHorse/status/1015698331459174400	
caliyuga	2018-07-05 09:16	0	0	There’s no such thing as Antifa. Stop wearing boot laces or anti patches. Every single free person in this country has a responsibility to defend that freedom. That means fighting fascism & racism however we’re able. There are no soldiers against fascism. All of us must fight				1014860676236566528			https://twitter.com/caliyuga/status/1014860676236566528	
pramsey342	2018-07-03 15:49	0	3	I don't support those things. I support groups that take active stands against racism, fascism and oppression. If people are silent on those, I'm very skeptical of their anti-Antifa talking points, that's all.				1014234795704909824	1014200655756582913	ShanePlays DiversityAndCmx	https://twitter.com/pramsey342/status/1014234795704909824	
Bunderpants1878	2018-06-29 03:46	0	4	Also, we aren't members of ANTIFA either. Just anti fascism/racism. Which should be the default setting for any decent human being. At least the ones not trying to climb inside Yaxley-Lennon's bottom.

theshb23	2018-06-14 02:47	0	3	ANTIFA stands for "anti-fascist". While Antifa certainly has it's problem members, their platform starts with being against fascism. Only those engaging in fascism or racism would be alarmed by them. So I see why they are a boogeyman for you.				1007152613282869248	1007122124228702208	CoreyStewartVA	https://twitter.com/theshb23/status/1007152613282869248	
eenygma_20	2018-06-05 15:13	0	0	No, they CLAIM anti-fascism while employing fascist tactics & rhetoric. I've heard more racism from "antifa" than any other group, & I live in the South. Actually, I was an adult before I ever heard a racial slur used in my presence, & the speaker wasn't white, nor conservative.				1004078867974377472	1003729888480768000	cjdeas10 mutt1960	https://twitter.com/eenygma_20/status/1004078867974377472	
viob2016	2018-04-27 17:14	0	0	Antifa has a very long history and standing for "anti-fascism" it is preferable to KKK and NeoNazi organizations. BLM is an international activist movement, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people. You do agree that there is racism in US, do you?				989976149244735494	989272096940404736	Sharpmommaddie StephenMilIer	https://twitter.com/viob2016/status/989976149244735494
