hammockdstrct9	2018-07-16 09:53	0	1	a dog doesn't choose to be someone's pet either. Not my point. I just happen to be impressed by bomb and drug sniffing dog skills.

Rottnkids2	2018-07-09 23:08	0	2	Would this man have yelled at a Bomb Sniffing dog’s handler or a police dog’s handler? No! What is wrong with people? It’s not about them and not getting to “pet the doggy.” It’s about someone’s safety!

IvePetThatDog	2018-06-17 20:53	297	5289	I pet Gunner. He is a 6 year old retired bomb sniffing dog who now works as a service dog for a veteran. He is trained to turn on the lights and open doors. Since he retired, loud noises like fireworks scare him. When he is not working, he likes to play fetch. pic.twitter.com/ZJ9AQkjOGq				1008513094216110080			https://twitter.com/IvePetThatDog/status/1008513094216110080	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Df71Tz7U0AAOgYG.jpg
