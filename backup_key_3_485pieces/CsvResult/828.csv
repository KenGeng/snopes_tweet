Abrasive1David	2018-06-07 06:05	0	1	It comes down to Eisenhower waiting until 1944 to invade France while Russia was knee deep in German infantry battalions. Russia begged USA and England to start their western front in 1943 to take some of the weight off their soldiers but that didn't happen. USA snubbed them.				1004665631113990145	1004433191556481029	davidBlandry UncleSteveInGa philosophrob	https://twitter.com/Abrasive1David/status/1004665631113990145

Russia had a large amount of female infantry soldiers, and a female sniper team. Britain air dropped 50 rifle trained woman for a assassination mission.				999553464651825158	999541071867768833	MrTehBanga Doctor_Thomas rob_pearson86	https://twitter.com/OhLadyMeg/status/999553464651825158
