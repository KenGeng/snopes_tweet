He’s one of the past who gave Billions of dollars to Iran, the Country that hates the United States and chants “death to America” . His opinion is just a word salad. Can anyone say what he did for us? # NOTHINGhttps://twitter.com/theblaze/status/1017252586200686592 …			# NOTHINGhttps	1017290876412944385			https://twitter.com/wenks_susan/status/1017290876412944385	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f621.png

I wager that those feelings have gone from "Death to America" to "God Bless America."
