good4politics	2018-05-18 11:55	0	0	Absolutely. I don't think a person who refuses use a firearm to protect the children has any business being a teacher. It should be a minimum requirement, like in Israel.				997505967859249152	997501884750426113	angelfitzpat51	https://twitter.com/good4politics/status/997505967859249152

NoahCuree	2018-03-24 23:50	0	2	Those 7% of teachers should have the right to carry if they wish to do so. No one has said that all teachers have to carry a firearm. After a school shooting in Israel in 1974 teachers were allowed to have access to firearms and since then only two such shootings have occurred				977754469134979073	977729786524119040	heather_kris KyleKashuv POTUS	https://twitter.com/NoahCuree/status/977754469134979073

Despite their criminal negligence, some teachers, administrators and staff had training, permit to conceal & carry firearm they could have minimized the deaths.				972024736321425408	963967302365581312	BillClinton	https://twitter.com/MarkPet87871033/status/972024736321425408	
dhart2001	2018-03-08 10:55	0	0	If they want to "beef up security", they should do it like Israel does. One armed security at school entrance (with EXTENSIVE firearm training). NO armed teachers. Total gun control (EXTENSIVE background checks, MANDATORY firearm training, etc.) They maintain serious protection.				971776540571615233	971766503426097152	nytimes	https://twitter.com/dhart2001/status/971776540571615233

NationRant	2018-02-26 21:54	0	0	Every citizen in Israel is required to serve in the armed forces as well. Which means they are already trained in firearm use. In America we have more teachers than the entire population of Israel. Who pays for this?

glenn_wofford	2018-02-26 14:53	0	0	A concealed firearm is just that. Police also go through retention training even in the UK. Teacher training will be no different if they do it properly. By the way, Israel has no shame in protecting their children.				968212435986501633	968079232478871552	NewcastleOpenF SjdsCeecee PrisonPlanet	https://twitter.com/glenn_wofford/status/968212435986501633	
LoriSums	2018-02-25 13:38	2	5	@ tedlieu GOP not going to have any teacher’s back who carries a firearm &doesn’t turn out to be a superhero. If they have an accident/don’t successfully take out threat the GOP will turn on them.

noahaphilli	2018-02-25 09:20	1	5	Honestly I think it’s a bit of a ridiculous proposition... and saying that the practice of doing so in Israel is applicable here I disagree with. Keep in mind that the vast majority of Israeli teachers have had firearm training in the IDF! http://crwd.fr/2oxR8Uq				967766190398562304			https://twitter.com/noahaphilli/status/967766190398562304

jfkenney	2018-02-24 19:36	0	1	What I suggest is better gun laws, just like Europe Canada and Israel has, despite recent efforts by the right to pretend Israel doesn't have such laws.. I don't suggest have a teacher keep a firearm a sociopathic student can lay hands on easily enough.				967558932830019584	967555282590208002	BarNiazov	https://twitter.com/jfkenney/status/967558932830019584

Secondly, were talking about those licensed to concealed carry be allowed to carry in school. They already have the license and the firearm. I personally know of 3!
