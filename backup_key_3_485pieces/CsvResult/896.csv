The momentum against Daesh started during Obama's final term.				1019314279483355137	1019168625012297729	MacTroll5 Imamofpeace saniyusuf	https://twitter.com/sjwtbh/status/1019314279483355137

Article 4 has been invoked five times for incidents in the Iraq war (UNITED STATES), Syrian Civil War (SYRIA) and the annexation of Crimea (RUSSIA). Looks like NATO countries coming to the U.S.’s defence. /4				1017091687993110528	1016729137409486853	roxannelwright realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/roxannelwright/status/1017091687993110528
