You didn't disavow or express extreme moral outrage over the life of a child being threatened! Instead, rather, you said to the World that Infant death is, Eh... https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1020749822557474816 …		@ HuffPost		1020753589466042368			https://twitter.com/JosephIanF/status/1020753589466042368

RegidorDelaros3	2018-07-19 13:18	0	0	Our world has one problem, basic family economics.this is really the main reason for infant abuse or genocide. There is nothing more hurtful to a mother than to sacrifice the life of a child over hardships and devastation. Some have done this, a sad ugly reality.				1019994922185871361	869935756755832833	SCUSBoardChair SavetheChildren	https://twitter.com/RegidorDelaros3/status/1019994922185871361
