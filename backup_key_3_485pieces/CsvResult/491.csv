NommeDeTwit	2018-07-17 09:23	0	1	Having a condensing boiler means a wait for the water to become hot when you shower, I always have buckets ready so we can collect the cold water so it's not wasted. We then use for hand washing, teeth brushing, bathroom cleaning and to clean the car.				1019210869836779520	1019194844462440448	SouthernWater	https://twitter.com/NommeDeTwit/status/1019210869836779520
