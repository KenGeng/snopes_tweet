YumTower	2018-07-14 16:57	0	1	And why in the world would a Canadian think that Trumpski is his President. Canada has a Prime Minister by the name of Justin Trudeau and although we may have our faults we have universal health care and a long history of human rights. By becoming personal you admitting defeat.				1018238200391852032	1017481505558450176	KingNatalieking ThanyiaResists	https://twitter.com/YumTower/status/1018238200391852032

DavidDeMera7	2018-07-11 08:06	0	0	The Danes love good humor. Did the Danish media cover Justin Trudeau's eyebrow wigs falling off at the G7 summit in Canada? It was a huge story in the US.

YaskiwDavid	2018-07-09 09:40	1	3	When you get to Latvia--is there any way that you can just stay there and not return to Canada! We could then get a PM that has had a job--is not a groper --and their eyebrows don't fall off!!
