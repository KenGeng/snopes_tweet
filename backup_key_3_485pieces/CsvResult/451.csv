imfamousbabyx	2018-07-21 15:16	0	0	When you sit in line at @ Starbucks for 15 minutes and you finally get to the window and they don’t say hi or sorry about the wait or even repeat how much I owe. They just open the window and stare. Then when I paid they just closed the window they didn’t say a word.		@ Starbucks		1020749488913182720			https://twitter.com/imfamousbabyx/status/1020749488913182720	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f914.png
Dominique_Miles	2018-07-21 14:37	0	1	Does Starbucks say “I’ll have your total for you at the window” so people don’t get out of line after hearing how much they’re about to spend on coffee?				1020739516217389056			https://twitter.com/Dominique_Miles/status/1020739516217389056

glorytothegod	2018-07-16 20:12	0	0	Once a guy was driving away from Starbucks with his coffee on the roof of his car so i waved at him and he rolled down his window and said “i have a girlfriend!” and as he drove off with his window open coffee spilled down into it. Pure bliss.				1019012028143316992			https://twitter.com/glorytothegod/status/1019012028143316992
