Jordan_A_Blanco	2018-07-21 12:07	2	7	B/c there’s a difference between not believing the same thing and this. You believe vanilla ice cream is the best kind. And I don’t. That’s what you described. Donald trump systematically and explicitly oppressing and demoralizing entire races is not a belief.

Remember the time you threatened Comey with tapes? This is your Karma. Cohen is waking up to what a horrible person you are which is your 2nd scoop of ice cream.				1020648888410271744	1020642287725043712	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/GinnieManson/status/1020648888410271744
