I have noticed in Canada as well as the United States Pro trumpsters rarely can give you an intelligent informed reason why they follow Trump. Memes gifs or referrals.

DavidCatherine	2018-03-02 12:27	0	0	Good question. Only speculating, but I wonder if the 2004 election played a role- remember the "United States of Canada vs. Jesusland" maps/memes immediately following?

jxc	2018-01-18 19:19	0	0	I would say to stop posting pro-Canada memes in a thread about the oppression of indigenous peoples by Canada, too. But that's not what you're doing. You're posting pro-America memes in a thread about the oppression of indigenous peoples by the United States. Don't do that.				954146149363003392	953363322891579392	kingfish7418 DelSchilling	https://twitter.com/jxc/status/954146149363003392

North America = Canada, The United States of America, and Mexico. Technically, Central America also counts. South America is also an America.
