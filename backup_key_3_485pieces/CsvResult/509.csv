Bush where he said clearly that Russia and the United States are not enemies. I think he made that statement upon landing into the moscow airport.

He uses Twitter because it appears to be the least restrictive of all the social media outlets and their trending stats show when he’s staying in the spotlight for the elections				1018659268545994753	1018074723140427776	darylblas RealStirfryguy	https://twitter.com/RealNegative287/status/1018659268545994753

UnknownSqwacker	2018-07-12 23:28	0	0	Cant you stop using twitter? Or is it to much of an ego boost for you? We need a new law that prohibits the use of social media in this way from the president of the united states. If you are serious about leading us, you do not have access to social media from personal items.				1017611646318063617	1017286281867481089	realDonaldTrump FoxNews	https://twitter.com/UnknownSqwacker/status/1017611646318063617
