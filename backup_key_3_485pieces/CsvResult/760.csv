alistaircoleman	2018-07-07 17:17	15	78	Well actually, it’s a common misconception that Kim Jong-un is the president of North Korea. In fact, that rôle is still filled by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, despite his death in 1994. pic.twitter.com/bJ1SgtazpM				1015706459550699521			https://twitter.com/alistaircoleman/status/1015706459550699521	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhiDor1WkAAz8ai.jpg
