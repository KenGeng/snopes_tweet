JesusGa22052812	2018-06-30 20:20	0	1	Democrats again protecting ilegals. Bernie we can't take all the world's poor. Where in the world are you going to put them. I live in south Texas and am surrounded with colonias full of illegals. I call the police about 2 times a week. Their loud music and shooting guns is bad.				1013215676625022976	1013079374004936705	SenSanders	https://twitter.com/JesusGa22052812/status/1013215676625022976

Vegas shooter registered dem shooting 500 at a mostly conservative event. No coincidence.		@ SenSanders @ GOP @ RandPaul	# BLM # Antifa	1012181624589570049	1012174975061647360	Silencedugud WA92660343 realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/RobStarkey79/status/1012181624589570049

FBI ignored two complaints against him. Texas church shooter didn't have crime info input into nat. database				1006649292738752512	1006637266943373313	Spartan_155D SenSanders	https://twitter.com/SecondContArmy/status/1006649292738752512

abnsmith	2018-05-22 06:30	0	0	odd thing, most mass shooters are or are from Democrat backgrounds and families. None of them have been NRA members and an NRA member stopped the Texas Church shooting.
