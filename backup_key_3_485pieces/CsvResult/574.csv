She's mixed race, but in the United States if you have some African American blood you're automatically labeled as African American and your European heritage is completely ignored. I think this is a societal issue. # raceprobems			# raceprobems	1020651920460009474	1020334442072731648	KimberlyNFoster	https://twitter.com/Ige_World/status/1020651920460009474
