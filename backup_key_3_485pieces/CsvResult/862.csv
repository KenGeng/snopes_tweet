OK_Dumbass	2018-07-21 16:35	0	0	Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland & Iceland don't seem to have those problems. Maybe Venezuela's problem is that it has an authoritarian leader. Don't know if you're aware of it, but authoritarian leaders are bad. And worshipping them is a really bad idea.				1020769144650821632	1020751162457427968	davencrisweaver JamesThompsonKS	https://twitter.com/OK_Dumbass/status/1020769144650821632

RusiAlpo	2018-07-20 12:20	0	0	Indeed. Germany failed and Sweden & Finland believed in the integration of Russia. One example. The Northern dimension of the EU was wrongly re-directed by Prime Minister Lipponen to become the "bridge" EU&R ,although the original idea was to strengthen ND of the EU.
