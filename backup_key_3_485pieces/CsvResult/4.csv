Also fuckloads of moose and bear, so that part kinda scares me 'cause I'm a bitch. pic.twitter.com/Vy1sV0jbLu				1017206506759041025			https://twitter.com/RCMX93/status/1017206506759041025	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dh3XnDVWAAAquHu.jpg
flytravelmag	2018-07-11 20:06	0	1	Sockeye salmon! The bold colors of sockeye salmon when they reach the river waters of the Bristol Bay region of Alaska are enough to draw in anglers from all over the world. And the bears are interested as well!

Brooks_the_Lab	2018-07-02 18:54	1	2	That's like when my human's brother-in-law was on a fly fishing trip in Alaska and he shared the big salmon he caught with the grizzly bear. That bear was like El Guapo - when he wants the fish, he takes the fish.				1013918774439710720	1013917222182498304	JesseKellyDC	https://twitter.com/Brooks_the_Lab/status/1013918774439710720
