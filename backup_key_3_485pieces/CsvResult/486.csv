This is male domestic violence victims, homelessness, and workplace deaths, all receive overwhelming government support. Oh wait.

They won’t be happy until they create mass homelessness & force people to starve to death or simply die from lack of health care. They won’t be done until we’re all living a nationwide revival of “The Grapes of Wrath”. https://twitter.com/RepBarbaraLee/status/1019718492185034753 …		@ GOP		1020567571408420864			https://twitter.com/d_waldrep/status/1020567571408420864

Being twice hit makes anyone look like they have nothing to offer, sad that these are many only words that pass fast in time many rush.				1020504353155604480	1020132437257523201	KPCC MicheReports	https://twitter.com/Zekepotpie/status/1020504353155604480

LumberjackCycle	2018-07-20 11:21	1	7	Zero traffic deaths is the only morally acceptable goal. It’s similar to the VA’s goal of ending Veteran homelessness a few years ago.
