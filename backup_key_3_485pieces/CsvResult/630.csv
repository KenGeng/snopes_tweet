dxysnt	2018-07-21 05:30	0	0	I saw my friends reading newspaper, or just news on the website, or being aware of the environment. Meanwhile, me...... Reading comics, watching cartoons, watching an uneducated youtube channel. Maybe it's true that i'm mentally 12 or even less				1020601977602838529			https://twitter.com/dxysnt/status/1020601977602838529	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f4a9.png
ApokolipsPimp	2018-07-17 16:36	0	0	Well I lived in a small town for good chunk of my life and the nearest LCS was 2-3 hours away. Got into comics by the cartoons. Moved and now I get trades either online or at a bookstore a few blocks away. Comics need to be in grocery stores and gas stations again like newspapers https://twitter.com/NewTSage/status/1019290017900920832 …				1019320052489818112			https://twitter.com/ApokolipsPimp/status/1019320052489818112

LetItMelo	2018-06-21 11:02	0	0	I think the newspaper is the barrier. Most kids know Garfield through cartoons and branding. Plus the comic isn't the business anymore (the brand is). He's kind of an Anti Hello Kitty. Davis also seems to be "over" comics. He's credited as the sole writer of Garfield Gets Real: pic.twitter.com/abcesC8fw2				1009813820037107714	1009806682967429120	akpruitt	https://twitter.com/LetItMelo/status/1009813820037107714	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgOUCSAV4AcE9PN.jpg
