How about, instead we mandate annual family health check ups for those individuals instead, which would include drug testing, etc. Welfare reform is an absolute necessity to properly assist those who honestly need the help...		@ realDonaldTrump		989958632845512704			https://twitter.com/xkylekc83x/status/989958632845512704	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/990029483783737349/ecU7DW4D_normal.jpg

Again, you failed. Maybe you should undergo a drug test, since you are so unsuccessful.				984444756339150856	984174528388567040	LepusPunk lej2343	https://twitter.com/LepusPunk/status/984444756339150856	
LepusPunk	2018-04-12 10:35	0	0	Again, this is a test about WORKPLACE drug testing. It says nothing about STOPPING drug use. So far, neither link has shown how effective putting welfare recipients through drug testing has stopped drug use. What else do you have?				984439788836188160	984174528388567040	lej2343 thehill realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/LepusPunk/status/984439788836188160

Everywhere this has been done, we've expended more to set up a contract to pay testing labs to test recipients than we've saved				952995852347494400	952200041502068736	michaelsegroves archeng18	https://twitter.com/michaelsegroves/status/952995852347494400
