ITSilverspoon	2018-07-19 04:40	0	0	Among the world's best, fighting the world not so correctly claimed to be "Super Powers" How can they be? Syria is standing & Bashar Al Assad is still standing as is Statue of Liberty & Big Ben. https://twitter.com/Angelforce900/status/1019017240535027712 …				1019864644784132096			https://twitter.com/ITSilverspoon/status/1019864644784132096

That was no joke there. He free'd most of Syria. Remember that before you trash him.				1015090045945024512	1015076164149207040	chertex vfran2	https://twitter.com/chertex/status/1015090045945024512

What do you know abt Welfare laws? I guess we r no longer the America of the Statue of Liberty poem...				1009725369547567104	1009156360829788160	e_t_davis NumbersUSA	https://twitter.com/mykidsrnutz2/status/1009725369547567104

Thankfully they were taken in..as per Statue of Liberty which says??? USA was BUILT on immigration!!! Families DoNOT need to be split Up!!! I’m disgusted with you!				1009142197629915136	1009103217001549824	scotcraig1983 IAmMardikins VeroVero777	https://twitter.com/SooozeKerr/status/1009142197629915136

Set expectations by destryong the Statue of Liberty. The People should reset the principles and politicians can legislate accordingly.				1008800285089783809	1007019318293553153	JSS0911 jacobsoboroff	https://twitter.com/JSS0911/status/1008800285089783809

jlfowler	2018-05-26 09:46	0	0	No, the poet Emma Lazarus said that—ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY! Since you mention Jesus, he NEVER said "feed the hungry, but only after everyone in your house is fat and rich". So, the poor people of Syria, Iraq, etc. being slaughtered while we turn them away that's "god's will"?				1000372536037830657	1000056650735091713	gretchenbarton KatDeepState	https://twitter.com/jlfowler/status/1000372536037830657
