Go through the pass from Jackson Wyoming to Utah and on your left there will be a sign that says best burger in Idaho and it’s no joke.

GeoWash111	2018-07-04 03:34	0	0	7. In the town I live in there no signs of a major uprising, there is no mud slinging across the isle unless it visits and passes out the mud. Said plainly, there is no revolution going on in Montana. I hear its the same in Idaho and Wyoming as well. No nothing at all...				1014412021801017344	1014394705365200896		https://twitter.com/GeoWash111/status/1014412021801017344	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/936017827911180288/1S9cSViP_normal.jpg

petesaltas	2018-05-29 23:40	0	9	I passed by a city on the Idaho/Wyoming border called Freedom. There was a "Welcome To Freedom" sign and everything. Alas, I should have taken a pic of the sign. But, I did roll down my window to find out what Freedom smelled like. FYI. Wet cow turd. Exactly like I thought.				1001669713749983232			https://twitter.com/petesaltas/status/1001669713749983232
