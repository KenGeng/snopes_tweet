nosugarnocreme	2018-05-12 10:14	0	0	This is so true. Vox put out an infographic about black people & police brutality, & didn't mention that Native Americans are even more vulnerable & it was clearly on the chart they produced. Natives have it worse than anyone, but they don't have the numbers to make anyone care.				995306206968283136	995301401948577792	CurtisScoon	https://twitter.com/nosugarnocreme/status/995306206968283136

This is a very specialized, manipulated statistical chart to fit their narrative.
