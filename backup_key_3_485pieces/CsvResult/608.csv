KindraF1	2018-07-21 18:27	0	0	But I will say that the continents of Africa, Asia and Europe are dangerously close. And then there's the whole business of tribes like the Yamasee/Jamassi of North & South America who don't exhibit too much of a variation in color. pic.twitter.com/vOnrg1fYxf				1020797452746731522	1020758300609179648	VibeHi	https://twitter.com/KindraF1/status/1020797452746731522	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f602.png

That's just how they structure their people it provides order				1020793622982037505	1020568952999727104	dekadaughter DrBeileh	https://twitter.com/hzzbt/status/1020793622982037505

The predominant tribe in South Africa wasn’t even there before the Boers were.

gingerlovesBenz	2018-07-21 16:26	0	0	The fact you are quoting an article by a 3rd party to Africa's history. Who Is writing Africa's history, it's not the indigenous people of Africa. It is distorted.Tribes lived homogenously for centuries. Also the term Bantu, is a colonial term. Hate that term.

They have illegal exotic hints here in the states. Back in some game reserves in Africa it can be mandatory the meat given to local tribes .				1020739722673455105	1014844149298749440	yesiama_hunter	https://twitter.com/LoriannaDovali/status/1020739722673455105

gingerlovesBenz	2018-07-21 14:25	0	0	No borders I meant. Secondly it is important to be careful who you source of history is. The Khoi and San were not the only exclusive tribe. The same Wikipedia you use as a source lists MAPUNGUBWE as the first pre colonial kingdom of Southern Africa.				1020736660311625728	1020350407829204993	k3170Makan ewnupdates	https://twitter.com/gingerlovesBenz/status/1020736660311625728	
gingerlovesBenz	2018-07-21 14:04	0	0	You do realise there were borders in Africa before colonization right? San and Khoi are the oldest tribe know to man correct but Mapungubwe dates back to 1000 AD. In1652 the Khoi were not the only tribes that had settled South. You know your story. now to educate others...				1020731294794375168	1020350407829204993	k3170Makan ewnupdates	https://twitter.com/gingerlovesBenz/status/1020731294794375168	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f60e.png

k3170Makan	2018-07-21 13:11	0	0	South Africa was colonialized first by the Bantu tribes that is the real history. It's only because the Bantu tribes consider colonialism a purely "white thing" that they don't consider their own actions towards the Khoi San also a colonialism, a taking away of land and freedom.				1020717999186010112	1020350407829204993	gingerlovesBenz ewnupdates	https://twitter.com/k3170Makan/status/1020717999186010112
