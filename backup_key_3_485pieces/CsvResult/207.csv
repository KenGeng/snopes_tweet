SheaUpperDeck	2018-07-21 01:13	0	0	How do you not know which part of your body is hurting you? Especially with foot/heel pain. The more logical story in my opinion, is they knew what the issue was, but Cespedes does not want to have the surgery until after the season.				1020537230450978817	1020519519377293312	TimBritton	https://twitter.com/SheaUpperDeck/status/1020537230450978817

GrungeJeannie	2018-07-11 01:07	0	0	I have a 5 inch scar on the back of my left calf & scars on my left foot & heel from a successful surgery in 2009. That’s why I can’t wear short skirts or short dresses or high heels. So obviously I’ve never stripped or danced professionally or ever done anything immoral at all.				1016911893104156672			https://twitter.com/GrungeJeannie/status/1016911893104156672	
sinkinsorrow	2018-07-10 22:56	0	4	1/5 Resection of the Tarsal Coalition Quick note on my surgery. Everytime I say bone was taken out, everyone is like: HUH??? Well, two of my bones the heel and a bone on top of my foot were connected and should not have been, these are the calcaneus and navicular bones.				1016878820677357568			https://twitter.com/sinkinsorrow/status/1016878820677357568	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/993545835983056896/hFajBbUX_normal.jpg

MartinFootAnkle	2018-07-09 15:15	0	2	Plantar fasciitis can cause pain in the bottom of your heel or in the lower part of your middle foot. This can be extremely painful but 99% of causes are cured without surgery! # PlantarFasciitis # Pain # MartinFootandAnkle			# PlantarFasciitis # Pain # MartinFootandAnkle	1016400384112431105			https://twitter.com/MartinFootAnkle/status/1016400384112431105

scottmtkd	2018-07-05 16:30	0	0	Lying about bone spurs to get out of service was illegal. Coward Trump writes about going out on foot to collect rent for his dad and going out to dance clubs, etc. He didn’t have heel spurs, and he didn’t have surgery to get rid of them. He’s a cowardly liar.				1014969888639725569	1014657219827126273	WAC_Veteran JamieRippa ColbyCovMMA	https://twitter.com/scottmtkd/status/1014969888639725569	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f44e.png

Circumference of a baseball-sized scar covered with a skin graft from my thigh thru half my heel and half my arch left after surgery. Wear sunscreen, hats in sun. No tanning beds.
