Lananalula	2018-07-21 17:01	0	0	Repudiate? Late in the 2016 Trump said ”President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period”. The reversal came after Trump had refused to acknowledge Mr Obama’s American birth to WAPO responding to a question on his views by saying “I just don’t want to answer it yet”.				1020775760225816581	1020771733471727616	CortesSteve	https://twitter.com/Lananalula/status/1020775760225816581
