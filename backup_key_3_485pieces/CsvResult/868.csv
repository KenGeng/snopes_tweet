An attack signifies that a person was injured or the shark shows intent to bite. The shark did NOT return nor follow through.

pfflindsyadigg	2018-07-11 11:36	0	1	They’re called the bull shark because they thrash around to make the water murky so their prey can’t see it before they attack their prey they bump them as a bull would.

THE_Eric_Allen	2018-07-02 15:49	0	0	Wow there.... Sharks are amazing animals and don’t just attack anything. Most shark bites are exploratory. The bull sharks is the one dumbo that doesn’t care what it eats. I want to go free dive with a great white, but as a human I wouldn’t be stupid and go to Seal Island.				1013872343268188160	1013855080418816000	wx_becks AlanYuhas	https://twitter.com/THE_Eric_Allen/status/1013872343268188160	
thornburyt	2018-06-26 06:36	0	2	Great White or Bull Shark. They’ve survived longer than the dinosaurs, swim gracefully and are generally chill, don’t attack unless they need to, but usually win. Their only real threat is humans by the waste we ignorantly and selfishly dump in their world and they hunt us.				1011558799839285248	1011429158541459456	Beaker	https://twitter.com/thornburyt/status/1011558799839285248

alaphelion	2018-06-13 14:59	0	1	Bull sharks are aggressive, and tiger sharks eat kind of whatever, so these two are the most likely to attack people. However, sharks are very picky eaters and most don’t mean to attack humans in the first place, but there have been very few cases of sharks biting twice				1006974232994066432	1006974218473336832		https://twitter.com/alaphelion/status/1006974232994066432	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1018997434645540864/8zH6Zu-w_normal.jpg
