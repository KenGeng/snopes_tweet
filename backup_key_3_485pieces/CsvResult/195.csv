Olga87713422	2018-06-27 11:41	0	0	In the Victorian era, people took photographs with their deceased family members, who would be propped up and made to look like they were living. This was called post-mortem photography. # HIST100CSmr18			# HIST100CSmr18	1011997879026712576			https://twitter.com/Olga87713422/status/1011997879026712576

alanlovespoetry	2017-11-13 07:45	0	2	Thank you! I’d been reading about post-mortem photography, how Victorian-era people would have photos taken with their recently-passed family members and got the idea for the poem.				930054015680991232	929889163729498112	ACLiddle83	https://twitter.com/alanlovespoetry/status/930054015680991232
