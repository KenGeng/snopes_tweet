LpdlcRamirez	2018-06-27 16:36	1	3	Not only, during the Mesozoic 100 million years ago the Earth's magnetic field was 3 times stronger. A time when the poles had little or no ice, more CO2 and a high biodiversity (hot). Solar activity and our magnetosphere have a very strong impact on the climate (cloud cover)				1012072262810423296	1012048037156401154	BeingRaymond Jakegsm	https://twitter.com/LpdlcRamirez/status/1012072262810423296

Tracey1024	2018-05-09 10:27	0	2	The Moon isn't protected by Earth's magnetic field.

TomsFineVideo	2018-05-08 03:49	0	2	You got it. The idea is that the interplanetary magnetic field (extended helio-magnetosphere) can be perturbed by solar prominences, or can help CME's tunnel; either can "ding" the earth's magnetosphere, which in turn transfers forces fore and aft to the iron core of the earth.				993759780215840768	992540282900987904	Karen1954 Pin_Seaker	https://twitter.com/TomsFineVideo/status/993759780215840768	
yestiseye	2018-05-02 05:29	0	0	So every 300,000 years or so, the Earth's magnetic field flips i.e. north becomes south. It would mean for at least a while the planet would lose part if not all the protection the magnetosphere provided from the "solar wind". You underestimate how robust human DNA is.				991610660524965888	990890615469690882	M_Sighil	https://twitter.com/yestiseye/status/991610660524965888

Astropartigirl	2018-04-22 20:18	3	23	Important: the Earth's magnetic field plays a huge role in auroras. It's why 1) we don't die from the radiation of plasma---magnetosphere deflects most of it, and 2) why aurora occurs at poles---the magnetic field directs the charged particles to the poles, which dazzle the sky!				988210446313209856	988193960509161473		https://twitter.com/Astropartigirl/status/988210446313209856	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1011669954326716417/An3GpD0J_normal.jpg

twatterfull	2018-03-20 17:20	0	3	It's the interaction of highly energetic particles hitting the Earth's magnetosphere. They're channelled down towards the poles and then interact with the oxygen molecules to give a green glow. The shimmering effect is due to the movement of the magnetic field-lines.				976206827338821632	862469275440861185	Nutt007 hplarc12345	https://twitter.com/twatterfull/status/976206827338821632
