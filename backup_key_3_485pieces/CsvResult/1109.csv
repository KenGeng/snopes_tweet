BenardMF	2018-07-13 11:01	8	13	Megan Napoli describes 1955 to 2018 weather and amphibian phenology at Mohonk preserve. Earlier calling in wood frogs, earlier egg laying in spotted salamanders.

VoteJenLunsford	2018-07-02 13:51	25	53	This is the Wood Frog. The NYS Senate recently voted to make this cute little guy our official State Amphibian! They did not vote on APPR reform, the Child Victims Act, Extreme Risk Protection Orders, the CCCA, or on the Reproductive Health Act… but we nailed down that frog! pic.twitter.com/u3MvT23kl8				1013842695243091968			https://twitter.com/VoteJenLunsford/status/1013842695243091968	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhHkidFX4AEJ2fl.jpg
CohenAvery	2018-06-24 09:00	6	10	The GOP-controlled NYS Senate passed a bill recognizing the wood frog as the official amphibian of NY yet cannot be bothered to pass a SINGLE measure of legislation advancing the civil rights of LGBT NYers since 2011.

Sean_S_Ewart	2018-06-14 13:59	0	0	@ LizKrueger said she’ll vote for @ JohnDeFrancisco’s bill making Wood Frogs the official amphibian of NY... but under protest because prettier amphibians exist.

Bill sponsor @ JohnDeFrancisco says it's a "lesson in govt" for 4th grade class in Skaneateles NY that came up with the idea.		@ JohnDeFrancisco	# NYS	1007299803846455296	1007293194776739840		https://twitter.com/TomPreciousALB/status/1007299803846455296	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/449548627464040448/1JwL0cf4_normal.jpeg
