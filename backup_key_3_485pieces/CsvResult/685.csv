DrMicrobe	2018-07-20 09:07	0	0	TY. But Jog Training story is not currently on front page of NY Times web page. At least I did not see it. However, plenty of negative Trump stories. And the MSM wonders why folks are losing faith in unbiased reporting of important news.

bluoreen	2018-07-12 09:33	0	0	You always say the US is almost twice size the economy of China, maybe you should check out the CIA web page for GDP ranking. And for the tariff, I don't think China needs to retaliate at all, because you're trying to hurt China by hurting the US.				1017401512517963776	1017362207426908160	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/bluoreen/status/1017401512517963776	
AndyDing13	2018-07-09 17:27	0	0	The Snopes web page stated that "The Rightists ... added several fake quotes in relation to Donald Trump", and the alleged Hillary quote in the original post is among one of the fake quotes.

The main fact checker web page is: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker … An interesting page is dated May 1, 2018 when Trump's lie count hit 3,001.

Howard10Rex	2018-07-06 07:18	0	0	@ realDonaldTrump Hi, we should have a web page for skills inventory available and current location. Businesses are having some difficulties finding a skill match for a given job. Similar, businesses should be able to post jobs, skills and location in the same database.

Scroll to " @ realDonaldTrump" and click. No need to follow him to do that.		@ realDonaldTrump		1015002899116519424	1014520426842738689	GraveyBongos taryngracia1	https://twitter.com/girlweena/status/1015002899116519424
