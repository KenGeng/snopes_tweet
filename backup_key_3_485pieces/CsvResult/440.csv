Pierson voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election and has listed Malcolm X as her political idol, stating that Martin Luther King, Jr. was "too moderate." https://twitter.com/BryanDawsonUSA/status/1016063331306823680 …				1016200685027807232			https://twitter.com/Jazzbo99/status/1016200685027807232	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhnINnNVQAAXQuS.jpg

Balgowallah	2018-02-23 16:29	0	0	Barack Obama likes to quote Rev Martin Luther King Jr. Or more specifically, all the anodyne, "Kumbaya" bits. What he needs to read is Malcolm X's "Letter to the Grassroots", specifically the section on the "House Negro". Fits him to a T. https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/966704319658647553 …				967149462639452160			https://twitter.com/Balgowallah/status/967149462639452160
