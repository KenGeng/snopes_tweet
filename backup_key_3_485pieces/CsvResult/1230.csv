FahKyoo	2018-07-20 12:26	0	1	I wanted to follow in my father's footsteps and join the Marines, but was recruited by the Navy. Unfortunately, I had a heart murmur and would not have passed the physical for either. I staunchly support our military though, and will fight for our soldiers.				1020344171754901506	1020123156831338496	RealJamesWoods AF_Academy	https://twitter.com/FahKyoo/status/1020344171754901506
