FernRiddell	2018-07-19 15:21	0	10	Not great. Or people seeking you out on any social media. I bourght a Christmas tree from a pop-up place down my road when I first moved in, they carried it to my flat, it was 5 minute conversation and I only told him my first name. 8 months later he messaged me on Facebook, https://twitter.com/elenacresci/status/1019898422575468544 …				1020025952838062080			https://twitter.com/FernRiddell/status/1020025952838062080	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/979752566660698117/RfHWVElp_normal.jpg

Your stan decided it would be cute to expose some of Ava’s information to her life outside social media.				990295402095235072	990280388013641728	EmxPlayz	https://twitter.com/pgisoverparty_/status/990295402095235072	
rayalexander01	2018-04-23 17:41	0	1	At BBC journalism we knew all about that Christmas Tree (never taken seriously) & worked with ppl who had various political views and in Belfast with republican or loyalist opinions. But they never let it influence their principles or reporting. Unlike any "social" media.				988533330034479104	988484314118742016	dabeard	https://twitter.com/rayalexander01/status/988533330034479104

hannaheray	2018-04-10 22:27	0	9	Welp. Looks like my grandma is expanding her social media presence. Not sure which is more entertaining: her sliding in my DMs or the fact that her whopping 2 posts include half a Christmas tree and a close up of her palm... & 50 people still followed her. # GrandmasGoingViralpic.twitter.com/0hU9Tm9r64			# GrandmasGoingViralpic	983894276353544192			https://twitter.com/hannaheray/status/983894276353544192	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dad-oKPU0AA1lRb.jpg
erichoward717	2018-04-04 17:56	0	1	Isn't a 10% chance a 90% chance it will not happen? Looks to me like you state the facts, it was an outlier. If you don't state that remote possibility and it happened, you would be lit up like a Christmas tree on social media.				981651641777770497	981648283830546434	BGoodeWAVE3	https://twitter.com/erichoward717/status/981651641777770497
