If I felt a need for contact with an infant all I had to do was go to town or go see a random cousin.				1019980085644922881	1019907940197728257	elektrikgypsy	https://twitter.com/SinDomme/status/1019980085644922881

Doulamaddie	2018-07-17 14:00	0	1	Yes mothers are blamed whatever they do, I agree! Breastfeeding counsellors are so used to being accused we can get a tad defensive! As to childbirth - maternal and infant mortality was mostly down to public health and sanitation not smthg inherently wrong with women's bodies.				1019280727958016002	1018526522746040320	NTKOMidwife TheDoulaElement	https://twitter.com/Doulamaddie/status/1019280727958016002

The only shame here I see is someone who purports to be a health professional clearly so ignorant of the facts of infant feeding...oh and if the history of childbirth as a cherry on top!
