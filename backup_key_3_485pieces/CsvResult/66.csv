ARandomRebecca	2018-07-21 03:28	0	0	No person is killed during abortion. A fetus or embryo does not posses consciousness or individuality of body on a human scale. Regardless bodily autonomy is a absolute right.				1020571215998734336	1020288751300378624	ValhallaGreeter ShaunKing kanyewest	https://twitter.com/ARandomRebecca/status/1020571215998734336	
JudicialRptr	2018-07-20 18:55	0	1	In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court stated that a pregnant woman “carries an embryo and, later, a fetus.” A woman makes a child when she gives birth to a fetus. The life of a child begins at birth. Otherwise, abortion would be murder.				1020441998107598848	1010270969003298816	danielmhenry OregonJOBS2	https://twitter.com/JudicialRptr/status/1020441998107598848	
RandalRauser	2018-07-20 14:18	0	9	Calling the embryo/fetus a "baby" in discussions of the ethics of abortion risks blurring the important developmental differences between embryos, fetuses, and neonates. Failing to call the embryo/fetus a "baby" risks objectifying/depersonalizing the unborn life.				1020372383419412480			https://twitter.com/RandalRauser/status/1020372383419412480	
acolemanxo	2018-07-19 18:28	0	5	How do you get an abortion at 20 plus weeks then play it off as a miscarriage? You didn’t have a “fetus” or “embryo”. You had a whole, growing, breathing, baby! You chose to have an abortion. & to try to pass it to people as a miscarriage because you’re ashamed is disgusting .				1020072908562026496			https://twitter.com/acolemanxo/status/1020072908562026496	
_liivvsss	2018-07-19 15:31	0	1	of course yes, I am pro-life and always will be but if you decide to have an abortion then that’s your choice to make and you shouldn’t be bashed for it, but what’s the need for all these names? “embryo, fetus” it’s a baby is it not?				1020028293184213000	1020027674260123648		https://twitter.com/_liivvsss/status/1020028293184213000	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1019969333131448320/0R4bhvn1_normal.jpg
_liivvsss	2018-07-19 15:28	0	1	one thing that confuses/annoys me in the abortion controversy is 1.) how can something not alive form itself? 2.) embryo/fetus means ‘an unborn or unhatched offspring in the process of development’ and offspring means ‘a persons child or children’ ... so is it a baby or not?				1020027674260123648			https://twitter.com/_liivvsss/status/1020027674260123648	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1019969333131448320/0R4bhvn1_normal.jpg

merlyn413	2018-07-19 09:49	0	1	No. The mother’s body is hers, and the decision is also hers. I don’t see abortion as murder because a fetus/embryo has no rights. I wish that no abortions ever happen, but that’s not my decision to make.				1019942264783527936	1018314635282350080	CaptainAir727 mbsevans5	https://twitter.com/merlyn413/status/1019942264783527936	
kennethlang	2018-07-19 07:47	0	0	Seems @ CBSThisMorning supports having embryos being brought to life, but skips fetus right to be born, then care about children staying with parents. Say abortion rights advocates worried about giving embryos too much status.

concedith	2018-07-18 19:16	0	1	I knew republicans would never pass a nationwide bill that says “women’s right to an abortion”. But because republicans love guns not women, we instead put “right to a gun in the womb”. The plan? find a way to put a gun inside a uterus having the embryo/fetus commit the abortion. pic.twitter.com/mBgcVVZFFy				1019722549125529600			https://twitter.com/concedith/status/1019722549125529600	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DibIP-DVsAEzt7p.jpg
DCampoamor	2018-07-18 16:32	3	15	Friendly reminder that abortion has nothing to do with babies. The word you're looking for is fetus and, in a large amount of cases, embryo. The number of emotional men who seem hellbent on labeling an embryo a "baby" in an attempt to undermine abortion rights is just annoying.				1019681405004001280			https://twitter.com/DCampoamor/status/1019681405004001280	
She_Brings_Joy	2018-07-17 20:42	0	7	1/ The majority of abortions aren’t done before six weeks- but before 13 weeks, which would obviously include those before 6 weeks, but would not be limited to that period. An embryo has discernible limbs by 8 weeks. By 13 weeks, a fetus is less than two months from viability.				1019381984571871232	1017235777011486720	tayvanderlaan	https://twitter.com/She_Brings_Joy/status/1019381984571871232

diomed1	2018-07-17 07:22	0	2	There is a difference between an embryo and a fetus and I am a firm believer that abortion should not be allowed if it is in the fetus stage. Also, abortions should NEVER be paid on the taxpayers dime.				1019180422734012417	1018577271878275072	SpikedGiraffe1 rn_deplorable drjill33	https://twitter.com/diomed1/status/1019180422734012417	
BinJohnathan	2018-07-17 06:21	0	0	Abortion is the ending of pregnancy due to removing an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus.

Murder is "the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another." Abortion is murder.

Vickisfunstuff	2018-07-15 21:30	0	0	First it's not a baby, it's a fetus or embryo that could develop into a baby. There are numerous reasons why a woman would seek an abortion.
