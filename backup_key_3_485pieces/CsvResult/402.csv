briboo567	2018-06-21 16:59	0	0	Pffff, New England are the Patriots Donnie. Minnesota's the Vikings. Understandable though since you hate the NFL and teams have no desire to visit the White House				1009903631716573184	1009900676355379200	UnfollowTrump	https://twitter.com/briboo567/status/1009903631716573184	
Rosebush2670	2018-06-05 17:38	0	0	So why were the New England Patriots allow to come to the White House even though they kneeled during the National Anthem? Because our racist President know that the Philadelphia Eagles are 68% Black and 4% Hispanic. These men did not kneel throughout the whole NFL season.				1004115352027041792			https://twitter.com/Rosebush2670/status/1004115352027041792

I am not a patriot or eagles fan but at least robert craft team owner bill belachick and Tom Brady are trump fans.
