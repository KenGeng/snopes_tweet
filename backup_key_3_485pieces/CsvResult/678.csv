JCRahm	2018-07-20 22:55	0	0	Anyone who knocks a person out in a “game” of knockout, should have his testicles cut off and fed to killer whales. While he is bleeding, he is to be fed to the killer whales alive. This is merciful considering he will die quickly.				1020502415781621760			https://twitter.com/JCRahm/status/1020502415781621760

jamft	2018-07-20 18:05	0	0	But at least we are finally learning what is killing the Killer Whales on the West Coast. Contrary to the eco-types, it might not be Alberta Oil, or tankers, or pipelines, unless it's the pipelines that carry sewage from those green people in Vancouver. http://www.focusonvictoria.ca/july-august-2018/vancouvers-role-in-the-chinook-sewage-orca-death-spiral-r10/ …				1020429485278048256	992567699678072833	jamft fortiain	https://twitter.com/jamft/status/1020429485278048256	
Kimberlee711	2018-07-20 16:16	0	0	They haven’t taken an animal out of the wild since the 70’s. Most now were rescued and can’t be released, like Ty, Aku, the pilot whales. Most of the killer whales were born there. The ones born in the wild came from other parks.				1020402081096781824	1019641311199137792	chelsiegambo Gem5251	https://twitter.com/Kimberlee711/status/1020402081096781824	
rapala61	2018-07-20 10:50	0	2	It’s like if the killer whale is conscious of the bird’s level of intelligence. It doesn’t try to hide it’s intentions, it just waits there. I wonder what they think about us.				1020319942279909377	1019751621767528449	MoodNature HistoryToLearn	https://twitter.com/rapala61/status/1020319942279909377
