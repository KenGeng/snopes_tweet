stevendrowe	2018-07-20 23:36	0	1	What is the Salvation Army stance on LGBT issues now? Places where I have worked, still to this day, refuse to deal with them as they don't meet their equal opportunity values.				1020512854145884161	1020510651720929280	steven94117	https://twitter.com/stevendrowe/status/1020512854145884161

Just_A_Pilgrim_	2018-07-16 05:32	0	1	I would be interested to know what action the police take against LGBT activists when they graffiti churches, threaten violent attacks including rape and arson. The hate that Asher's bakery has faced, hate videos against the Salvation army, all because they won't say gay is ok.				1018790455616602112	1018419925591961600	theweeflea ancresbyjacq	https://twitter.com/Just_A_Pilgrim_/status/1018790455616602112	
dominick_robin	2018-07-16 01:30	0	0	I'm sorry that the mob mentality has forced you to need to explain yourself like this. I support the Salvation Army bc they house + feed homeless, but ppl complain they are anti LGBT. No matter what you do, someone will find a reason to complain.				1018729541290876928	1018259097827897346	elonmusk jack_p	https://twitter.com/dominick_robin/status/1018729541290876928

ArsTacitum	2018-07-12 09:02	0	8	I would avoid Salvation Army, they fund anti LGBT groups. If you're around SoCal, specifically the LA area, there's a thrift store chain called Out of the Closet which is by and for the LGBT community.				1017393796676386817	1017382684824350720	JimmyTudeski6 TerraTimberWolf	https://twitter.com/ArsTacitum/status/1017393796676386817	
jonnay	2018-07-11 08:50	0	1	Note that the only thing they can say here is that they don't discriminate on the delivery of their services.

abigailgershon	2018-07-09 21:14	0	0	Did you know that approx 40% of those people are trans & LGBT youth?

TheCheesyChin	2018-07-08 22:37	0	0	The Salvation Army is tax payer funded. It is religiously based (hello 1st amendment), and has an abhorrent track record of discrimination against the LGBT community. Its CEO has been quoted as saying he’d refuse service to an injured, dying gay person.				1016149194241986560	1016135548312797185	justiceorkarma	https://twitter.com/TheCheesyChin/status/1016149194241986560

BrianYVRmP	2018-07-08 08:44	0	1	Unless you are LGBT, then the Salvation Army prefers you homeless and hungry. How about you disgusting people go out on a Santa Clause suit and go beg for money elsewhere? I’ll give my money to organizations who don’t discriminate.				1015939659426172935	1007677435213697024	salvationarmy	https://twitter.com/BrianYVRmP/status/1015939659426172935

Wpg_Wenis	2018-06-29 08:36	0	0	Except, this isn't true. The Salvation Army helps people of all races, religions, and sexualities. All photos to the contrary have been proven false. In Winnipeg, they just opened up a shelter specifically for LGBT people to fill a need.				1012676052076957702	1007677306800951297	MxMaegen salvationarmy	https://twitter.com/Wpg_Wenis/status/1012676052076957702

katielovestea	2018-06-24 17:31	0	0	And I don’t want to sound like I’m hating on their customers. CFA has made huge strides recently to dial back their corporate donations to anti-LGBT organizations (other than the Salvation Army). But for some people that hurt doesn’t go away. So we find other options.				1010998833629843456	1010998430351519744		https://twitter.com/katielovestea/status/1010998833629843456	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/977580495176265729/z4peUn_X_normal.jpg
