rodswift2	2018-07-04 13:07	0	1	Too slow for me. Depending upon the trunk diameter I would leave up to 3ft of the trunk for leverage, dig round & use an axe to chop through the roots until the tree stump was persuaded to fall over.				1014556331745869825	1014529735932694533	PatrickW	https://twitter.com/rodswift2/status/1014556331745869825

From 1931 to 1934, she carved a whole menagerie of creatures into the stump of one of Fitzroy Garden’s original Red Gum trees to celebrate Victoria’s centenary. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fairies-tree?utm_medium=atlas-page&utm_source=twitter …pic.twitter.com/y0LhbTZnW2				1011423176520171522			https://twitter.com/saunieindiego/status/1011423176520171522	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DglMAttVMAEh5Lf.jpg

JurassicLore	2018-06-15 23:37	1	3	In JP's Isla Nublar, we see our first dino: "Grant saw a single trunk with no leaves at all, just a big curving stump. Then the stump moved, and twisted around to face the new arrivals. Grant realized that he was not seeing a tree at all." He's looking at a dinosaur.				1007829544584163328			https://twitter.com/JurassicLore/status/1007829544584163328	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1019098375000485888/a1b-jvV4_normal.jpg

If you want to kill a tree, cut it down and grind out the stump.				1006339686057566214			https://twitter.com/AndrewSwaim6/status/1006339686057566214	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1013837861655900160/bNZxsDH6_normal.jpg

Stage 1 of the removal of some diseased Trees has also created a visually better approach shot and potentially an easier one too!				1003622141613559808			https://twitter.com/stuartwilsonpro/status/1003622141613559808

Uncertain as to what trees may replenish themselves from a trunk, but the photo of the Cottonwood looks like a huge stump rather than a trunk, but do believe many fruit trees and other trees may regenerate from a trunk..				997547538327703554	997260460423512065	PizzaDudeSez AlyssaRhocks	https://twitter.com/Suzanna_danna/status/997547538327703554
