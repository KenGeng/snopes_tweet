Surely you're well informed and keen to discuss them?				1020775891662540800	1009657394459054080	debbie1ala AustLiberty	https://twitter.com/SquadPolitical/status/1020775891662540800	
portraitof	2018-07-20 16:59	0	0	In your original post you mention Tommy Robinson - he isn’t a freedom fighter, he isn’t oppressed, he is not fighting systemic racial prejudice. He talks about Muslim grooming gangs but is silent in wider child abuse, he talks about the barbarity of Islam whilst ignoring how 1/				1020412834247831553	1020392188021272582	karlspe68639588	https://twitter.com/portraitof/status/1020412834247831553	
wrxmanpaul	2018-07-20 10:55	0	1	It was pretty obvious by the first letter of his first tweet. These people are happy with their faux concern as long as they can attack Islam & Asian men. Never mind the that 90% of child abuse is committed by white men because it’s really important to stop the ‘real’ problem				1020321317135044613	1019480387947581440	C4VAALLI AhmedLoonat	https://twitter.com/wrxmanpaul/status/1020321317135044613	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f644.png

gracefulgravity	2018-07-18 18:37	1	14	That is called child abuse and neglect, and there is something seriously wrong with the mindset that finds it acceptable, let alone preferable.

wrxmanpaul	2018-07-18 14:56	0	0	No, it think it’s important to point out child abuse. Regardless. If grooming gangs were due to Islam then I’m pretty sure every street in every country would have one. Instead, every town has a white male child abuser. See how quickly you disregard white men are child abusers.				1019657072370176000	1019480387947581440	jasonnixon4 AhmedLoonat KTHopkins	https://twitter.com/wrxmanpaul/status/1019657072370176000

rtcprox	2018-07-18 05:54	0	1	I can easily be more racist than Lee Hurst. Watch: "The prophet of Islam had sex with a pre-pubescent child. There is strong evidence of increased child abuse rates among muslims as a result of the practice being given timeless sanction by a religious role model" See. Racist.				1019520761151803392	1019348590156709889	LennieMerrick1	https://twitter.com/rtcprox/status/1019520761151803392

The implication that Islam has a monopoly on violence, misogyny or child abuse is ludicrous.

MsDayglo	2018-07-15 20:00	0	0	If people have legitimate concerns but don’t want to be seen as racist, they should raise those concerns away from racists. Don’t conflate worries about radical Islam (which is a valid concern, but something to keep in perspective) with worries about child abuse, for examples				1018646505257914368	1018412331687034881	Loiner_nick77 HappySpaceInvdr	https://twitter.com/MsDayglo/status/1018646505257914368

I think this is the point he was trying to make, it seems to be only Catholics copping the flack. No, I’m not Catholic, but I believe in fair play.				1018046490751561729	1018002377998139393	maccprin56 TonyAbbottMHR	https://twitter.com/GailClifford7/status/1018046490751561729
