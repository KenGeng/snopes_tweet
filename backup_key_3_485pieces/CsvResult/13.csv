tmsalexa61	2018-07-21 15:10	0	0	So the president of the United States is allowed to decide how employees of a privately owned company will be treated for participating in lawful protests that their Company Owners may/may not choose to deal with in their own way?

G2milano	2018-07-21 13:44	0	0	It is more important for the leader of the United States to stand up to the brutal dictator of Russia then for football players to not protest during the national anthem. Perhaps we should all kneel during the anthem until you grow a set.				1020726292679995394	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/G2milano/status/1020726292679995394

Petgroceries	2018-07-21 12:47	0	0	How is it that the President of the United States doesn't know the words to our National Anthem or to God Bless America? And yet, Trump continues his harangue of NFL players who peacefully protest.

I would also say quit obsessing over peaceful protest of a heinous issue, but while you’re doing this you aren’t sell out The United States to Russia China and N Korea.				1020704264077930496	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/motorcitygor/status/1020704264077930496

You're the President of The United States, but even as our first 'moron con artist' President - even you know that every American citizen has the right to protest by kneeling.

onemike951	2018-07-21 09:33	0	0	You swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America when you were inaugurated.

Jeangreyhnd	2018-07-21 08:35	0	0	We are not worried about NFL players and their peaceful protest. We are concerned about the president of the United States that threw the nation under the bus.

emtfr	2018-07-21 03:24	1	1	Why are you purposely distracting American Public making a NON-ISSUE an issue? Solution: @ NFL is not owned by the United States. Don't play the anthem or display the flag at games. They'll still KNEEL, either in prayer-or protest of blacks being SHOT first questions asked later		@ NFL		1020570106051653633	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/emtfr/status/1020570106051653633
