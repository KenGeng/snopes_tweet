Deranged tRump is a traitor and a Russian spy!				1020731921851191298	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/jayemnl/status/1020731921851191298	
jeffhead9711	2018-07-21 00:03	0	0	Protest and dissent is what my America is about! They are not being disrespectful to the flag or the United States. It is a protest against racism, which right now is back to where we were in 1964. That it what you should be concentrating on. Oh, I forgot you are that problem.				1020519636029194242	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/jeffhead9711/status/1020519636029194242	
ryanvonn	2018-07-20 23:54	0	1	Most UNPATRIOTIC president in the history of the United States of America. Clearly against the Constitution of the United States of America, in which the right to peacefully protest is LAW. Impeach this treasonous son of a bitch!!!				1020517460250845184	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/ryanvonn/status/1020517460250845184	
sachbowers1	2018-07-20 21:12	0	1	Ummmm, we are not an authoritarian nation to be forcing anyone to stand for anything. We are the United States, and freedom to peacefully protest is a fundamental right. Forcing people to do things completely goes against the GOP decree of personal freedoms.				1020476627556487170	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/sachbowers1/status/1020476627556487170

foofoothesnoo55	2018-07-20 19:39	0	0	Which do you suppose is less patriotic, taking a knee to protest police killing black, unarmed youth, or taking sides against the United States of America for Russia and Putin? One is a constitutional right, the other is treason. Guess which is which?				1020453290813861888	1020432499082702849	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/foofoothesnoo55/status/1020453290813861888
