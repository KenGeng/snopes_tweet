TheRossBarkley8	2018-07-21 01:45	0	1	Dear White People, If you choose to be racist (because it is a learned behavior and a choice), and harass Black folks, understand that not everyone is going to simply tape you with their cellphones, and post it on social media. Some people will physically defend themselves.				1020545325713494016			https://twitter.com/TheRossBarkley8/status/1020545325713494016

MrSmithTP	2018-07-19 08:48	0	0	Here's what I see when going through social media. I'm not seeing tons of bash black people threads by whites. If someone does say something it's a national event. Meanwhile I'm finding constant threads all over bashing white people. But who's really the racists?				1019926954043232260	1018258900137775105	ActuallyyNicole truthrocker CBSNews	https://twitter.com/MrSmithTP/status/1019926954043232260	
KingofK67959356	2018-07-19 05:20	0	0	The problem is there not finding any black athletes that have tweeted racial things about white people when they were 17 or younger. It seems to be white kids with improper home training that continue to keep getting busted for committing hate crimes on social media.				1019874693267054595	1019449831423664128	AP_Sports SWhyno	https://twitter.com/KingofK67959356/status/1019874693267054595
