You must kill the entire cartel culture--knowledge, practices, network--and the only way to kill a culture is to kill every member who carries the culture.				1019866226070192129	1019743825873514496	BreitbartNews brandondarby BreitbartTexas	https://twitter.com/iggychevalier/status/1019866226070192129
