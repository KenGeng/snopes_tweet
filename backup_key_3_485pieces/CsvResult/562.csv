But I don’t remember the 2015 election being run again despite the rampant electoral fraud.				1020730917336375296	1020589331788988416	Paul1Singh	https://twitter.com/makinthemost/status/1020730917336375296

Frajud12	2018-07-20 22:02	2	6	What Harper can't wrap his mind around is why he lost 2015 election. CPC used public funds for a self promoting campaign in 2014, plus the electoral year one with their funds. He may not have expected international observers, to avoid electoral fraud, like in a Banana Republic.				1020489188066701312	1020358636470718465	Tintie4 ThatsMrNeil	https://twitter.com/Frajud12/status/1020489188066701312	
The_JPR	2018-07-20 16:14	0	0	It's interesting because the most widespread and damaging forms of electoral fraud involve right-wing groups fiddling election expenses or using dark money to break election laws, yet the Tories seem disinterested in this.				1020401469097328640	1020287374406889472	PeterStefanovi2 UKDemockery	https://twitter.com/The_JPR/status/1020401469097328640

AspieMum	2018-07-20 14:17	0	0	Electoral fraud when it comes to casting votes has generally been with postal votes anyway & most illegal stuff connected with elections seems to be connected with how the parties behave- especially the Tory party which seem to be investigated every election.				1020372257229680645	1020287374406889472	PeterStefanovi2	https://twitter.com/AspieMum/status/1020372257229680645

No doubt one of those ‘representative’ samples.

They deemed Vote Leave committed electoral fraud & the cheating so widespread the ref cannot be considered a mandate . It should be annulled.				1019960912508260354	1019960275150299136	ErnieTheMilk	https://twitter.com/SheronWilkie/status/1019960912508260354
