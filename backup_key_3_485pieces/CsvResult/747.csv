DeanMasello	2018-07-12 00:04	0	2	I’m all choked up. Recently lost my pound puppy after 14-years together. Beagle. I found him at the shelter after his previous owner had duct-taped his snout (at 6-months). RIP, bud. —Also, who plays this folksy tune?				1017258471924862976	1017114161535336449	OurHeroDogs	https://twitter.com/DeanMasello/status/1017258471924862976
