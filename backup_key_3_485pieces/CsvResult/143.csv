spence_arnold	2018-07-20 04:21	0	0	Hillary Clinton is president of the United States. All she has to do is contest the results and render them invalid, I still find it hard to believe that there could have been 61 Million Americans stupid enough to be conned by the Trump regime. That's because it didn't happen.				1020222165638139904	1020008975922810883	realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/spence_arnold/status/1020222165638139904
