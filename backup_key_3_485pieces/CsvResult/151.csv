carolynnicole	2018-07-20 13:02	0	0	Today is Tabi’s last swim class. Can I just say she’s the cutest little mermaid ever. I can’t post photos because she’s too little to be in the water by herself & if I’m in the water with her, I’m wearing a bikini & teachers can’t have bikini photos on social media.				1020353214032502785			https://twitter.com/carolynnicole/status/1020353214032502785	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/2764.png

DrivenByABeat4	2018-06-20 02:39	1	3	I remember I saw a concept on social media when AB is closing off the Fantasea line of albums, and it was a concept album that had to do with AB the mermaid coming on to shore (Little Mermaid - style) and becoming famous on land due to how different she acted. BUENO concept. pic.twitter.com/cfUPjyjSUl				1009324938514370561	943344997256040449	DrivenByABeat4 AZEALIAARCHIVED	https://twitter.com/DrivenByABeat4/status/1009324938514370561	https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f4a3.png
