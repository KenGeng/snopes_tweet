The views here are dramatic, enjoy the sunrises and sunsets too while here.				1020148365064003584	1020101127486898177	Anthony_Rentsch	https://twitter.com/40plusguy/status/1020148365064003584

I hate that because I have PTSD after losing a friend to a lightning strike 9 years ago that she’s still feeding off my fear from that. I’m much better.

Since things like that happen to me I probably shouldn’t # SCUBA dive a river during a thunderstorm like I did today.

4kDeep	2018-07-16 16:25	3	3	Gather up your loved ones if you are on # pinepoint beach right now. Swimming during a thunderstorm is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Lightning regularly strikes water and since water conducts electricity, a nearby lightning strike could kill or injure you... pic.twitter.com/Vic9r2VGSs			# pinepoint	1018954679919624193			https://twitter.com/4kDeep/status/1018954679919624193	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiQN2E8XkAE0fJC.jpg

BelLovesSims	2018-07-14 06:24	0	3	Not that I noticed I think maybe that takes a few strikes for that to happen. I did get a crystal from a different lightning strike.
