GerbusJames	2018-07-21 18:44	0	0	The Moon is moving independent of Earth & you assume the apparent motion of the Sun is from a spinning Earth, when in reality Earth is stationary & the Sun is circling just like every other celestial body in the sky.				1020801673353048064	862469275440861185	doctorbuttons BostonsBuddha	https://twitter.com/GerbusJames/status/1020801673353048064	
doctorbuttons	2018-07-21 18:24	0	0	The reason for this is that the moon is in a prograde orbit, so it moves slower across the sky than the sun and stars because as the earth turns it moves in the same direction.				1020796738662207489	862469275440861185	GerbusJames BostonsBuddha	https://twitter.com/doctorbuttons/status/1020796738662207489	
DevonTingle	2018-07-21 17:29	0	1	I had a dream that my family and I were rushing and packing. The moon was mad close to earth. I look at the night sky the moon started to crack and then it exploded and chunks of the moon came flying to earth. What does that mean.				1020782923157557249	1020742592290607104	MatteoLane	https://twitter.com/DevonTingle/status/1020782923157557249

AlienHere2Love	2018-07-21 10:56	1	5	In a lunar eclipse, however, the Earth is positioned directly in between the sun & the moon, so much so that the moon is swallowed by the Earth’s shadow. The Earth (Union) is directly in between its mother & father of the sky. It’s like double Union energy.				1020683996957757440	1020677736405372928		https://twitter.com/AlienHere2Love/status/1020683996957757440	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1018262571319734272/JPpbM4vI_normal.jpg

garysugar	2018-07-21 09:27	0	1	IMO Maya is an inadequate idea of Brahman. I don't agree BTW with making masculine and feminine cosmic principles. It's an obvious metaphor, but so are earth vs sky and Sun vs Moon. There are lots of finite distinctions that are not universal. pic.twitter.com/qUyHQaGL1a				1020661551051788288			https://twitter.com/garysugar/status/1020661551051788288	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DioeRM5XsAAZFoE.jpg

GregBufithis	2018-07-21 02:41	1	0	On July 27, a blood moon will glow an eerie red ahead of the longest lunar eclipse that Earth will experience in the 21st century. For 1 hour, 43 minutes, the moon will disappear from the sky, entirely obscured by the shadow that our planet casts upon it. https://qz.com/1331163/the-lunar-eclipse-in-july-2018-is-a-reminder-to-look-at-the-moon-every-night/ …				1020559321384538114			https://twitter.com/GregBufithis/status/1020559321384538114
