blufromhoo	2018-07-21 18:31	0	1	She was acting. She is to much of an intellectual lightweight to take on @ JudgeJeanine and was tasked to take JJ down. So she practised what the left are preaching. Aggression. She then felt ashamed and did what all abusers do, she blamed the victim. WG is a very big lefty SH*T.		@ JudgeJeanine		1020798371701944320	1020329851759284224	RNRKentucky chaosmanaged1	https://twitter.com/blufromhoo/status/1020798371701944320	
SusanRandall032	2018-07-21 18:28	0	0	I will not watch ABC ever again if Whoopi Goldberg is not let go from The View for spitting and cursing in @ JudgeJeanine face. You haven't even made a statement about it. What a disgrace. You made a statement and fired @ therealroseanne within hours of a tweet. Pathetically bias.		@ JudgeJeanine @ therealroseanne		1020797663053262848	996485744075067392	ABCNetwork	https://twitter.com/SusanRandall032/status/1020797663053262848

JFitz6510	2018-07-21 18:11	0	0	Hey @ ABCNetwork is there any reason why you cancel @ therealroseanne 's show and keep that vile @ WhoopiGoldberg and the rest of those vile hags on @ TheView on the air???

Some businesses went under or lost money. Low unemployment is good, but the people complaining they we're losing jobs weren't taking the jobs available				1020788206592319488	1020329851759284224	mojavethorn cjsheenX10	https://twitter.com/Hjdshopgirl/status/1020788206592319488

BallingerMarcus	2018-07-21 17:46	0	2	In my “view” @ WhoopiGoldberg displayed the same reckless type of behavior as reported about # RoseanneBarr. This behavior was shown both during the show and after. What is # abc going to do about it? Please tell me you plan for some type of recourse for whoopi’a actions.		@ WhoopiGoldberg	# RoseanneBarr # abc	1020787113137246209	1020342519396151296	BallingerMarcus TheView WhoopiGoldberg	https://twitter.com/BallingerMarcus/status/1020787113137246209
