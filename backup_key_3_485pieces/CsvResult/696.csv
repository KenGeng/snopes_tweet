cfagbata	2018-07-17 10:11	2	2	Albert Einstein was a man of pedigree and class. His works ranging from Theory of relativity(1916) to evolution of physics. His gifts were cropped from intellectual solitude, relaxation and music. His perspective to life has been admirable and one to portray. # CFA # Lifelessonspic.twitter.com/YwNhTlwFnB			# CFA # Lifelessonspic	1019223150918332417			https://twitter.com/cfagbata/status/1019223150918332417	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiUCDdPWAAIC8Hr.jpg
