HauberBilly	2018-07-21 15:27	1	2	Can’t anyone sue to stop. I thought only citizens were able to vote. If not why not cats, dogs, bears, pumas, wolves.sheep,goats, bulls, cows,horses, mules, donkey, and all the birds to. Snakes . lizards , fish, sharks, and grass and trees. Open voting to anyone, anything.				1020752036080562177	1020715067732570113	FAIRImmigration	https://twitter.com/HauberBilly/status/1020752036080562177	
willie_8	2018-07-21 00:54	2	0	This is what we call a “bull hauler.” Basically a trailer that hauls livestock. Cows, bulls, sheep, goat and to my surprise, pigs. I say surprise coz pigs don’t sweat. I thought we’d be more humane to do piggies like that in these 3 digit temps pic.twitter.com/BZ4XaRkpXf				1020532526471831552	1020531244449161217		https://twitter.com/willie_8/status/1020532526471831552	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dimo6ufWAAECwrv.jpg

loveservegrow	2018-07-19 17:17	0	0	He does, but like Jesus those teachings are rooted in right action over thought. Sheep's and Goats come to mind. To your point though there is right and wrong. Theology that leads to death is wrong as best as I can understand Jesus. It's why I changed my understanding				1020055139447705600	1019579918190080000	JeffreyANeal devinvaldivia	https://twitter.com/loveservegrow/status/1020055139447705600

PolaMuzyka	2018-07-18 10:37	0	0	The Lord is sorting out the sheep from the goats even now. He knows our hearts (thoughts, motives-body, soul, spirit).				1019592062860218368			https://twitter.com/PolaMuzyka/status/1019592062860218368	
MikeJHilliard	2018-07-18 08:36	0	0	Matthew 25:40b Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. The Cross places a demand on faith to express grace in thought and deed. The only difference between the sheep and the goats is what they did and didn't do				1019561437403009024			https://twitter.com/MikeJHilliard/status/1019561437403009024	
MetalRabbit13	2018-07-16 07:26	0	1	I don’t either but appeasement gets you treated the way a Judas goat treats sheep. Chamberlain thought that backing off Germany was a good idea because the Brits didn’t want war. Again. They looked weak & it went very badly after that.				1018819200167677952	1018817892283047936	CassandraRules	https://twitter.com/MetalRabbit13/status/1018819200167677952

craigbobie	2018-07-14 21:17	0	0	Idk, you know how chickens and roosters look different but are the same animal? That was basically my thought process.

Laurealism	2018-07-13 22:11	0	1	My dad tells a story of playing Pictionary with friends. He was repeatedly trying to draw a small goat-like figure while friends shouted out things like “Goat! Ram! Sheep!” Goatee. The word was goatee. He thought it meant baby goat. # metalkpretty			# metalkpretty	1017954634013519873	1017950133600899078		https://twitter.com/Laurealism/status/1017954634013519873	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/895140723733004288/Wh5pfnkR_normal.jpg

SusaMorgan	2018-07-12 02:59	0	4	I once had a ram who disliked the sheep. He thought that the Nubian goat, Sadie, was verycharming, though.
