LetsTalkDiana	2018-07-21 16:24	3	13	I'm not sure what's going on or who's fighting but Universal had a shared universe in the 1930s. Godzilla and Kong and the monsters have been teaming up and fighting for over 50 years. LET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS.				1020766449051357185			https://twitter.com/LetsTalkDiana/status/1020766449051357185

Jvogt200	2018-07-19 02:36	0	1	I’m not surprised that something like that had a spirit attached to it, especially if it is something that was of importance to that said person. Do you know the story behind that bear besides it being from a the 1930s and that an dead old woman was in possession of it?				1019833246962601984	1019820971757264896	Garrett_Watts	https://twitter.com/Jvogt200/status/1019833246962601984

ProEuUk	2018-07-18 18:27	10	31	Watching that old woman at the free Tommy rally on # newsnight being interviewed, it suddenly struck me. She could have been in the 1930s, talking about Jews rather than Muslims. I cannot believe this new 'free speech' era allows such views on TV.			# newsnight	1019710219109138432	1019699285145870336	agirlcalledlina	https://twitter.com/ProEuUk/status/1019710219109138432

Remember they are basically cowards who attack you because you as a woman dare to oppose their fascist narrow minded point of view .				1019635366847045632	1019135677731102721	carolJhedges	https://twitter.com/1949muzza/status/1019635366847045632
