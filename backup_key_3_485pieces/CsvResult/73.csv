apetivist	2018-07-20 01:07	2	9	Conservatives say that election "meddling" isn't actual warfare but they are wrong! Cyber warfare is a form of warfare just like nuclear warfare is a form of warfare! Putin/Russia attacked our democracy and Trump acts like it is no big deal!

DawnHam5	2018-07-17 14:10	0	1	There is no system of protection that is perfect for cyber or nuclear warfare. It is the very reason we have the U.N. and International Law to govern the behavior of the world’s countries. Obama implemented Sanctions on Russia through the U.N. & Trump wants to back out of the U.N				1019283194552741888	1019238616671883264	bevanpet Tracydelfeljoh1	https://twitter.com/DawnHam5/status/1019283194552741888

JoeGuillotin	2018-07-16 19:37	0	0	Trump has chosen to up the ante on nuclear warfare by stockpiling/funding more, rather than the gradual drawdown of Presidents before. The Russia diplomacy is not in line with Trumps thinking.This is not a deescalation, this is ring kissing imho. Again, I politely disagree.				1019003179277615104	1018943446583668736	KuKluxTurtle brianyegge	https://twitter.com/JoeGuillotin/status/1019003179277615104

philbower1976	2018-07-16 19:08	0	0	Cuba actively plotted US annihilation by means of nuclear warfare, that's pretty bad and quite honestly makes trying to influence an election look like peanuts. But the point is, Obama still met with the brutal regime to forge ties, in the same way Trump is with Russia.				1018995826847182849	1018817424085405697	garym426 CNNPolitics realDonaldTrump	https://twitter.com/philbower1976/status/1018995826847182849
