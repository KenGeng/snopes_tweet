AnnMarieMooney2	2018-07-11 22:35	1	3	Did you ever see the White House Correspondent's Dinner when it was hosted by Seth Meyers? I think this meme is from that dinner. If you haven't seen it, look it up on youtube and treat yourself to belly laughs! Seth Meyers is so, so, so, so funny!!				1017236008172220417	1010268521715130369	nancyrbush pleasetryharder	https://twitter.com/AnnMarieMooney2/status/1017236008172220417

ozzyalan	2018-06-07 07:31	1	2	Chaos. Such a liberal meme. From where we sit, Trump has succeeded against astonishing odds despite a liberal soft coup attempt. The fact that obama is still whiteanting trump tells u all u need to know about the man.				1004687202838720515	1004402357092823040	ChangeTheLAUSD DykstraDame	https://twitter.com/ozzyalan/status/1004687202838720515	
denacamp1	2018-05-26 15:56	0	0	"President Trump got in on the meme game Thursday morning, with a retweet of an image that shows him "eclipsing" his predecessor, Barack Obama." What's racist about that? Throw that old worn out race card away and get real. Obama hung out with known communists and Marxists.				1000465608234827776	999740557793652741	calisandstorm Scavino45	https://twitter.com/denacamp1/status/1000465608234827776

Fireyhorse666	2018-05-01 03:05	0	0	Honestly, I don't see how the White House functions at all with any kind of normalcy from day to day. Insider fighting, Scandals up the Yazoo, Tweetstorms, Outrages, # TrumpRussia, Ethics Violations. Leadership begins at the top, folks.

squealandgiggle	2018-04-07 15:32	0	1	I think this account is either someone with a poor grasp of English or a kid. The memes are meh even after they've had the word salad fixed. Too much emotion, too little logic. I'd give him a D+, overall.				982702604227678209	982459154253086720	JuIi3t DonaldTrumpMike	https://twitter.com/squealandgiggle/status/982702604227678209
